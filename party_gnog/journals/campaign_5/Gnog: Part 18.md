# Gnog: Part 18
## Day 49 (Ravnica 29, Riglan 86 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Friday (7 day week)

We are at Rainbow Falls. It's day 2 into 'future goes black'. Tesseret has escaped to Amonkhet with most of the stolen equipment and all of the crystals.

We have breakfast up in the restaurant level, watching the waterfalls glitter in the early morning sun; rainbows as always. Gnog remarks, "Huh. We haven't had a day like yesterday since Skyreach... Also, how long has it been since we were home? I think we haven't been away this long before." Almost a month on Ravnica, we realise, and quite a few days before travelling and on the Rock Of Braal.

Deni spends a while continuing to transcribe a scroll into her spell book. Fee-Ree says she's worried about Arxcis - of course; Taz sends to Arxcis, "Fee-Ree's Party Sends Her Regards And Apologies For Our Absence Due To Urgent Duties Elsewhere. One reply is possible!" - he responds that he's fine! We figure - yeah, sending stones. And the pair we've got go to Fee-Ree and Arxcis, of course.

P5 is a good place to start. It's about 10am when we head out. Taz and Gnog try to find shops... Slow going (adv investigation still only 10 for Taz). There's a kind of goblin engineering shop in the Blistercoils, where we find two "Fargabs". backpack-sized devices that allow communication over long distances using new technologies - their many-per-day capability is interesting, and range is fine for District 10, but they're too big so we keep looking. We find an actual magic shop; a "useful items" store - "The Helpful Kender". Inside there hangs a picture of a cheeky-looking young, slight, above-halfling-height, smartly dressed male human with a topknot. Assistants in the shop are humans and goblins. We enquire about sending stones. We're brought to a "communications" section and handed over to a specialist gnome (!). We're asked to sit at a table while he pulls out a few cases. He opens each. "We have three different ones - what takes your fancy more?" - they're different shapes and made of different materials. We ask about price first; they range from 200 to 250gp per pair.

So... We almost bashfully ask... How much for all three? We explain our requirement and we are instead shown something different. More expensive but, the set he has is 650gp - four stones - but they all communicate with each other. That sounds ideal! Yes please, we'll take them! Taz doesn't feel we should barter; we just got 800gp from the Dimir anyway. Fee-Ree has the sending stones for Arxcis, so the two of them can send a message a day - in private.

"There is something else..." says the gnome. "I have this..." - he pulls out a beautiful scroll, which he describes as the "creme de la creme in communications!" - a scroll, Rary's Telepathic Bond. L5. Up to 8 of us would be connected for an hour. Deni would need *ten hours* to copy this, but it's very tempting. 8 is exactly what we need for the four or us and the other four of the "Five", including Jace. We say, "how much?" - 500gp, materials for transcription, 250gp. 750gp all-in. "Small price to save a universe" says Gnog and pays up. "Any freebies given all we've spent?!" says Gnog? We're given a paper bird. Nice! He gives us a bit of extra copying material too, maybe as much as 50gp worth at standard prices.

We thank him and head out. "What now?". We figure - well, the Dimir are meant to contact us, but in the mean time, maybe Nivix? But as we start to leave someone bumps into Gnog (perception 16) and he realises something was slipped into his pocket. A location - public baths! - also in P5, so, we straight there; back towards the Zonot Seven waterfalls. Heated pools underground, steamy; Roman bath style. The note tells us to "find a secluded smaller pool and wait". So we go and we find one, but the best we can do still has one person on it. Gnog wastes no time getting naked and getting in, then turns into spa pool with bubbles which cases the person there to look over in disgust and leave. Mission accomplished! (Gnog randomly chuckles at the memory of this for about the next hour or so).

An old man after a while walks our way, drops his towel and robes, then climbs in near us. Swims over. "Excuse me. Can I get in between you?" "...yes, OK"

Fortunately, this *is* a Dimir representative! "The cancer has been cut out and removed", he says. "Everything is sanitised, in no small part thanks to you." He confesses that when they'd first starting watching us, they didn't think it might be *this* significant. Gnog says that it's been a mutually beneficial relationship - and as the mist rises it disturbs the illusion a bit, it's Lavaz! As we get to the meat of it - he casts some kind of spell, to ensure privacy, still play-acting as if an old man, mumbling away; his voice ends up in Gnog's head. Telepathy.

Gnog explains about Vraska. Can they help? We'd be in Lavaz's debt if so. He seems very concerned at this.

"This is a procedure we can execute, yes... But it would not be an easy one... Please do not take that as reluctance. We simply need assurances, to set up a situation that gives those, because we don't know what memories are blocked; what will happen when that block is removed; different people react in very different ways. Vraska is not without power! It could be catastrophically dangerous for the person performing the procedure and anyone nearby. So the answer is yes, we can, but we will need some time to figure out a safe way to do this. Is it my understanding that you think she will do this willing?" "She will." "So would it always be correct to assume that she might willingly and voluntarily allow herself to be subjected to certain... Safety measures... And conditions?" Gnog thinks, then answers back, "She should. If not, she's not acting in good faith and we shouldn't proceed." "Very well. Let me speak to the mind mage who I know is able to perform such a procedure and I will consult with my advisors on the best course of action to take. I assume there is some urgency here? Is this going to be politically sensitive? Do we need to do it in secret?" "Yes, yes and yes." "I will do my best." "Thank you. We are once again in *your* debt." "No, we shall call it even - we came very close to losing control of the Dimir. I don't think you appreciate we came to the precipice! I am cautiously hoping that what we have now, is mutual trust and respect." "Certainly; after all, our lives may be in your hands in the fight to come."

The old man starts to walk away. "This is a new thing. A very new thing for us Dimir; it has been millennia since any Dimir considered anyone a friend and an ally." - and the connection severs.

After a while, Gnog says, "I think we won that one. Did everyone hear that, or just me?" Blank looks. Gnog explains in abstract terms. Deni confesses that, to her surprise, she's had enough bathing now! We head out.

Gnog writes on paper, "Friend, Hope You Find Success. We Have Evidence Linking Nikya to Bolas. If You Require Assistance, We Offer Aid. We Have Sending Stones To Make Communication Easier. Four Way. One Attached. Please Bring My Bird Back - It Will Be In Figurine Form! Best Regards, Gnog."; he activates the Raven figurine, attaches the note to its leg and the stone - these small Ravnican stones are great! to a small pouch he fashions around its neck. It flies off.

Paper bird to Kaya. "Tesseret Battled. Inevitably, Escaped Via Portal To Amonkhet With Equipment. Dimir Now Allied. We Have Sending Stones To Aid Communication. Request Meeting; Suggest Nivix, 1pm, Main Doors." - and the bird is flown.

We figure in-person for Nissa. Maybe we'll have time to drop in on Levinia, just for social catchup, as she may be concerned by all the militarisation. So, we cut across and start the long walk to P3 via P4. We can't resist picking up some coffee and ringbread on the way through! There's not much left but it's enough. 2 Azorius silvers. 

Encampments are now clearly forming and, in some cases, established outside P3. Lean-tos, other shelters, tents; on rooftops, against trees; there are more animals roaming around once we're inside and we see that the Selesnyans are patrolling too. Perhaps Nissa's hand is in this - get them to focus and be regimented, rather than panicked. Security is better too - more flow, more recognition of people; which would be an issue I guess, but for now, we just head in. Gnog has a quiet word with the guard as we're waved through just whispering, "don't forget to keep an eye out for magical illusions - we could be pretending to be someone you know!" "Yes, we are aware... This is why we have these!" and they point to hounds. A great idea! The dogs work off smell - good choice. Gnog grins and we head in, but he notices the weariness in their eyes and the similar look for the patrols. They're tired.

Inside is busy. Activities all over. Open schools, choirs singing, life is trying to resume. Nissa or not, things are looking much better here, despite the juxtaposition of many of those singing groups doing so while fletching arrows, or making spears, or feeding war animals, or doing drills. We head to Vitu Ghazi, looking for Nissa. Taz asks where she is - persuasion 19+13 (!) -> 32. He's *especially* charming! The very first person he asks invites us to follow them up the tree. We do so. Nissa is in one of the hollows, with a few young, teaching them about communication with saprolings. We sit in for a while to enjoy the lesson, but she sees us and the person who helped us waving at her, and she wraps up the lesson.

Gnog apologises if the lesson was interrupted. We're invited to walk with her; we go along boughs of the tree, to get privacy. We bring her up to speed - she's very surprised with how much we got done yesterday! Then she opens up a bit. "I think there are lines that you, like I, will not cross; perhaps more permissive than Ajani's but less so than Kaya's. But we fight an opponent who respects no such lines. That makes it a very uneven playing field, when there are things we will not do, and there are things that we *must* not do. It's the line that separates us from them." The issue of pressure points comes back again, like it did last time. This time, she says, "So. Let us make a pact." She creates blossoms. Hands one to each of us. She crushes one in her hand, beautiful bright blue. "Blue is a very rare colour in nature... Let's make a pact, to keep no secrets. For the secrets are what will rip us apart. Whatever reason you think you have to keep one, THAT is what Bolas will use." Fee-Ree and Taz crush their flowers. Deni hesitates; "But secrets can be important"; Gnog studies her; they both wait. Nissa picks this up. She makes a very persuasive speech to Deni, eloquent; and Gnog says that he trusts Nissa now as much as he trusts Deni. Deni knows she puts up walls, to protect from loss; she lies, she keeps secrets to craft an image of herself. She can't be vulnerable. It takes a lot for her to be so. She crushes the flower, but it is reluctant and uncertain. She holds out her hand, in an "I really hope this is not a mistake" way. Nissa thanks her. Gnog says, "You and I. Family, always. Always safe - and ever judged." He crushes the flower.

The five of us mix the blue paint in our hands.

Nissa asks where we're going; Nivix, 1pm; she says "let's go" and heads out.

D100 -> 26. On the way down, we see Levinia! She's in her beekeeping outfit. Gnog shouts a greeting! "Oh! Hi!" She's holding the helmet, heading somewhere. We briefly catch up, checking in. Things are OK. Bees are swarming which is a bit strange, but they do it sometimes. We mention the potential to evacuate underground, but realise she might want to protect things up here. As it happens, she's joined the Selesnyan guard! Swarm division. She hands Gnog some beeswax to try; chew on it and spit out the wax; she's added some new flowers. Gnog tries it. There is a blueberry aspect! He can truthfully say it's good. It's her new frontier - instead of flavouring the honey, get the bees to have different flowers instead. Gnog's hand is covered in honey - Taz uses Prestidigitation to clean that up. After she's gone, Nissa is mulling out loud - "interesting person... I can always hear her in the consciousness - I think she could really be something; maybe actually have a spark..."

We head back across. By the time we're at Nivix, it's about 12:30pm and we hang around a while, just chilling out at the canteen before 1pm when we return to the main gate to await Kaya.

At around 1pm, someone wearing a wide-brimmed hat. Gnog bursts out laughing, "Who is that? What an enigma! What a mystery!" - otherwise dressed like Carmen Sandiego! "Shut it!" shouts Kaya back. Gnog is chuckling all the way into Nivix. "Fine!" she says, taking the hat off. The afro expands out gloriously - "much better!" says Gnog. "We have a lot of catching up; but here, take this!" - and hands her the sending stone. "Four way! We can keep in touch. You can send once a day, and we all hear it."

Suddenly on the sending stone, as we're chatting, interrupting us - "Glorious! Can you hear me? This is fascinating! I have your bird! I am coming your way! Where should I go?" and Gnog laughs and sends back, "We are meeting now at Nivix, ask for Ral Zarek's laboratory and say that Niv requested your presence".

We head up. On the way, the first thing Gnog broaches with Kaya. Kaya is... Angry. We eventually to Ral's lab, but Ral is with Niv. There's one other person who might have the sigil to teleport; Ral's assistant. She's down it the sky lobby, in charge of arrivals and departures; some big deliveries today; her name is **Mina**. She has the "backup codes". We don't know or trust her; Gnog asks Deni to keep a *very* close eye on this person. We head to the sky lobby, looking for her based on a description - tall, a bit like Kaya, but with blue hair, but pushed / slicked back. Not hard to spot! She's wearing a Mizzium Apparatus sort of built into her suit and has a metal head band attached to a helmet (that's why the hair is pushed back, but is still quite tall, like an afro - Cleopatra style).

She looks to us and simply says, as a flying machine carrying a crate arrives, "We've recovered these" - they're the crystals we brought back to the planet - oh wow, so they'd lost them and found them again. "We intercepted them yesterday afternoon." Gnog says, "Well, Tesseret left to Amonkhet last night. We need to see Ral and Niv immediately." She says "Well it's lucky we got these back!" "Only if Ral can figure out a way to make the disruptor work when the signal is sent from Amonkhet not Ravnica..." and a voice interrupts, "Yes, he will!" - it's Jace. Of course. Heh. We help, carrying cases, following Jace back towards the lab and teleportation circle. We leave them by a wall and get to the circle. We all cram on and he casts Teleportation Circle. We pop up in Niv's lab. Gnog asks if there's anyone who can keep an eye out for Ajani; Jace says we've got a couple of course (good).

We bring people up to speed with what we've been doing - Tesseret gone, Dimir aligned, Golgari volatile but potentially aligned, evacuation possible but difficult, Gruul OK but Nikya might be corrupted or her sect is.

We learn that **Dovan has seized control** of all aspects of the Azorius. The Liev Column used precognitive preemption to supersede the usually independent authority of the other two Columns. **The Grand Arbiter has gone into hiding!** He opposed the takeover. Jace says, "I hid him. He's hidden, hidden... People will not find him." There's an arrest order for Vraska. We might be able to help, but right now, it's difficult and a deadlock.

Kaya says we might have an even bigger problem. Jace asks her to explain - because the Orzhov have frozen the accounts of key opponents in a mobilisation in defence of the city from terrorist attacks within, which the Isperia attack has become classified as. P1 is close to martial lockdown by Azorius / Orzhov agreement. Kaya says that the Vuliev estate is moving to seize estates and properties of all of the living Karlov family. With Taysa out of the picture, there's nothing Kaya can do to defend them. Kaya has tried to persuade the Ozbidat to lift the house arrest but they instead threatened to *escalate* it and hand her over to the Azorius for full arrest - for fraud.

Jace believes the Azorius to be lost, refugees from the guild trying to escape "justice". The Orzhov may be lost too. Dozens of high-profile arrests of the judiciary and legislative arm have been made, including the warrant for the arrest of the sitting High Judge. It is all Jace can do to keep *anything* within control, at least keeping it within the Azorius but it's leaking into P2 and he thinks we might lose P1 and P2 soon. He's kept the plaza and promenade to the Chamber free for now, just under the guise of allowing petitioners to reach it.

Niv adds to the cheery news. "Bolas is moving. We have devised a new plan. It is not going to be easy. We need to move the disruptor onto the Decamillennial Platform." Gnog asks about cargo amount; a single airship would do it, but obviously be extremely vulnerable. And you'd have to get everything *into* the airship. Very precarious while loading - the Sky Lobby isn't designed for that. Maybe with enough 'copters it could be taken in pieces up there, else ferried up to a nearby airship. 

Niv as usual won't reveal all the plan. He can at least tell us that "I can control to a degree where and when I think the signal will come through" "You mean the creation of the bridge from Amonkhet?" "Possibly." Insight only 11; Niv is perhaps not trying to reveal details. Gnog sighs and says, "OK, never mind, we hopefully don't need to know; first problem, get the pieces up to the platform. People need to install it, so those people need be up there; Ral needs to bring the team - we need security" - and Jace chips in - "yes, I will see if I can be there as well; we'll need hands on deck" - Niv responds, "I have no doubt that the moment this begins, attention will be drawn and we will need to defend it."

"How long -" asks Gnog - "when do we do this?"

"Days? Days. Within days."

Gnog says, "Would Gruul bodyguards help?"

"Possibly... All bodies are useful, for the installation alone will attract an assault. If you can convince the Gruul then having a meat shield would be very, very useful" (Gnog winces at that, but understands; we've been here before...)

"Is there anything we can do in relation to the Azorius, P1 or P2?" Jace says he could use help, if that's what we choose, to push back against the military forces taking over P1 and expanding out to P2. The Azorius and Orzhov security forces are working together and oppression levels are high. Anything we can do to push back will be helpful to the population at large. "Getting into New Prahv would be something of a priority if we were to tackle this head-on..." - Kaya adds in, "Yes, separately, within the Orzhov I have a plan..."

...and people list off plans. Everyone needs help of course! We can only be in one place.

Kaya is very sure she must eliminate the Ozbidat. All of the problems are flowing down from Grandfather Karlov and the Ghost Council. The only way to change that is to remove them from power. Gnog says, "If we do that, we can help decouple the private Orzhov forces and weaken the Azorius offensive". Jace's plan, pushing back at ground level to help hide people - helping refugees get out to escape capture - or infiltrate the New Pravh stronghold itself and do *something* to Dovan.

Nobody is really in charge of what we've done with the Dimir or Golgari. We should perhaps focus on those.

Jace suddenly interrupts. "Hmm. I think we need to go to the sky lobby right now!" and heads out - we hurry after him. As we approach we can hear slightly panicked voices saying, "No, no, you can't land here... It's not scheduled..." and a familiar voice bellows out, "I have come! All is safe, I have been summoned! Valour and courage are needed!" - it's Ajani, riding a glorious griffin - and the Sky Lobby team don't seem to have a clue what to do with it.

We get back to Ral's lab and quickly bring Ajani up to speed, then we hear what he's been up to. He had been dealing with Nikya. He says that Nikya is, really, just a figurehead. He met and battled a young barbarian shamen, **Domri Rade**. He grew up in the Wastes and can channel crazy magic, very powerful; Ajani isn't sure if it is innate, like a sorcerer, or given by an entity (our vote would be 'given', e.g. by Tesseret or Bolas, heh!) - but it's very wild and chaotic. Ajani tells us that Domri has, in essence, seized control of the faction; he's young, hot-headed, powerful and capable. He's been leading the assaults to the outskirts of D10 - not Nikya. The Gruul seem to be falling to his sway, since he has the things they respect. A compelling leader. Boboremos has a stronger challenge in him than Nikya.

Everyone still wants help.

We dig out the armour fragment from Tesseret and show it to Ral, telling him our theories of its material and that material's origins. He notes it is Etherium as an alloy/metal rather than a component of something bigger, used to channel magical energy.

Nissa agrees to help handle getting the Selesnyans to distribute information to the population about secure underground shelters, to which they should run if an evacuation is needed. She'll get them to figure that out so that they can do what they need to when the time comes - herd people to safety. The Kraul beneath will, by then we hope, have given permission via either Vraska or Savra. Meanwhile the Dimir are on the missing memory problem.

In the end we have to trust. Everyone needs help but the one person with nobody "powerful" assisting is Ral. At Ajani's suggestion, we will speak to the Boros - they have angels who can fly; they can help bring stuff to the platform. Everyone has their sending stones, Jace will "just know" if needed. There's a bit of a heart-to-heart with Ajani; he used to be more firey in his youth; more stalwart and controlled now.

We all go our separate ways; Ajani says he'll come with us to Sunhome. He asks Deni, "Deni! Would you like to ride on my griffon?" "Um, uh - well - " (and Gnog's like "oh, come on! You know you want to!") " - ...I guess it might be interesting!"

We meet up in the main courtyard at Sunhome - we go on foot! - while Ajani and Deni fly. When we get there, Deni and Ajani are chatting; she's learning of his world and things he's done.

We figure we want to speak to Feather, since we know her; she might be able to point us the right way; Ajani points out that really, we need the Angels of the (second) Parhelion. So we start by bugging Feather! The office is a hive of activity - it's very busy - everyone is overloaded. Feather sees us from her office-in-office in the corner; she beckons us over. She finishes up with someone in their office and we go in.

"We'll keep this as short as we can!" says Gnog. We get into it. We keep it brief. Aurelia we learn is vexed and disturbed by the behaviour of the Azorius. Very troubled by the turn of events. She "sees" more than we realise. On the subject of scrying, the Boros do what have to be done and deal with the consequences later; the spirit of the law; Azorious, the letter. Besides, most of that edict applies to P1 & P2, thinks Feather. She offers to bring us to Aurelia to find out if the angels can help; we thank her and proceed immediately, Ajani in tow.

Ajani says he'll head to Requisitions after this; Feather suggests we might check in there too, as they have some interesting artefacts...

The route to Aurelia takes us up higher. We get to what looks like some kind of war room! It has the map (of the whole planet!) figures, sticks to push them around - everything. Aurelia is there - "War Leader Aurelia", in full. The most senior of the Battle Angels. Her eyes are still pupil-less balls of light, so we gather that wasn't spells, the guild meeting where we saw her before, or anything else; it's just how she is. Sees through all manner of illusions.

She is alone here, deep in thought, stood looking at the war table, which has sections which can be separated and moved around (not one giant, unwieldy table). There is a long discussion about the nature of the threat; we're obviously very vague; in the end our best guess based on to-and-fro is Orzhov and Azorius biased tactical teams rather than a large assault.

* We'll need to figure out how to keep things safe in Nivix, given that we suspect internal security issues there, which could hit us while still on the ground

* A dozen strike crews (tactical angels) - 24 in total - to clear the skies and create a corridor for Thopters from Nivix while bringing up equipment

* Take the P3 garrison - Aurelio is considered trustworthy - to station on the platform; he is to be appointed temporary chief of guard for defence of the platform; he is authorised to muster all necessary resources from the garrison

We thank her and depart. Feather heads away, but not before giving us and Ajani access to the Vault Of Requisitions. This is a true vault, huge. Ajani goes off like a kid in a candy store. We find a requisitions officer - the Grand Quartermaster, in fact - and Gnog first shows the claymore, derived from the green dragon Chuth. There are many interesting weapons and artefacts, but we find - and not for the first time - that our own weapons, for all their shortcomings, are still surprisingly powerful and we're not persuaded to trade. Many things are interesting; none are sufficiently persuasive, especially if it means giving up an attunement slot!

Ajani, on the other hand, fills his boots. We head off, bid farewell to Ajani and head towards P3 to let Aurelio know the "good news"...!

When we get there, we first seek out the Commander Of The Garrison.

* We tell the Commander about the imminent threat; defences are being built; and that's where he comes in. He asks to see Aurelia's paperwork and we supply that.
* Aurelia has decreed that the Precinct 3 Boros division will be stationed on the Decamillennial Platform, to protect a vital piece of extremely powerful equipment being shipped from Nivix. To give an idea of its power and importance, no less than 24 tactical strike team Angels have been committed to provide air support.
* We trust and know Aurelio, and he is very familiar with the men in this division. For that reason, he is to take command of that force.
* Of course this is likely to be a shock - but Commander, you are needed here. The Selesnyans have amassed considerable military might, and should be able to defend their own borders - but they have no experience or leadership. Aurelio has little prior command experience, so would be a poor choice to command this unknown group. We need someone with the skill and knowledge to lead the forces you requisition, or that the Selesnyans choose to commit, to temporarily take the place of the Boros here.
* We do understand if you feel that at least some of your trusted men should be held back, because while we note that Aurelia committed the *whole* division, you may require others to hold things together here and (Gnog) respects the chain of command.

Persuasion Gnog with Guidance from Taz, total 25. The Commander does want to retain some staff, but is happy with Aurelio scheduling and commanding guards, making roster changes and necessary arrangements to get up there; he has the Commander's full support. Gnog stands, shakes his hand; "Thank you sir; an important step in the defence of Ravnica."

Aurelio, who had been called for, arrives; he's brought up to speed by the Commander, given instructions but also asked what he needs. Aurelio will gather troops on the drill grounds and will need us to help explain why they're up there and what they're doing. He asks the Quartermaster to have a map of the layout of the Platform produced. **Aurelio is given the temporary rank of Captain Of The Guard**.

This happens immediately, so we end up on the drill grounds. Gnog is able to channel his experience in the army to help be recognised by the troops (Character: Description: Feature: Military Rank). There is an explanation, some questions and we're asked if the restaurant is open; we hedge on that; later, with the men dismissed, Aurelio says we'd need the Azorius to pass a law to close the restaurant. We conclude that this is too visible - too much of a signal pointing directly at the platform - and despite the risk, elect to let it stay open. Aurelio and his men will plan accordingly.

Aurelio estimates that garrison's planning will be ready and they should be able to head up on the last airships tonight; the second watch will head up in the morning and they'll set up camp. Gnog says that we'll get to Nivix and get them to confirm the installation location and let him know by message.

We'll head back to Nivix to find out about that and discuss options for defence of the platform itself; we don't want Engineering compromised & the platform crashed!

It's getting on to 6pm now.

As we're leaving, we see the guards headed home; they'll be the platform's 2nd shift. The 1st shift will be the night watch, rostered in shortly. Aurelio will have a long day - night! - ahead. He says he is in good spirits; able to act openly and, almost, more comfortable in a time of war than peace.

At Nivix, people are packing up. We seek out Ral. He tells us that the Disruptor will be installed near the memorial gardens; a wide, open space that has a more commanding view. The power conduits, emitters and so-on will be installed at the old weather station. He does agree that anyone spare for the Engineering control room patrol would be useful and there is, indeed, only one way in and out.

Taz message Aurelio: "Main device situated Memorial Gardens. Defend against damage. Power system at old weather station. Defend against theft. Platform control, only one entrance, patrol if possible" (25).

Fee-Ree would like to catch up with Arxcis. We're invited, but it could be awkward! Gnog is happy for her to have alone time, but *would* like to get to know him. So she suggests dinner together - bring food to the apartment, Grinne and Mela and Arxcis and us eat together, then she spends time with him in town. We pick up food from P4 and head to the apartment.

The three of them are there. Fee-Ree says "We'd have messaged ahead, but we thought it might be a nice surprise? Of course we knew there's a risk you'd already have dinner sorted..." "Well no, we have some things soaked, but we haven't begun cooking - having food bought is always a treat!"

Cutlery and plates - not fancy but looks like the "for guests" stuff - is brought out. We sit around the living room and eat. The conversation turns to lighthearted and heartfelt, rather than the doom and gloom of business. There are more stories of the Red Wastes wilds, living out there. Gnog is fascinated. Stories of the publishing industry, and more! We chat for a good hour and a half. There's a slightly firey barley drink that they make themselves; the fire is from spice, though, with only a small amount of alcohol. Similar to ale. There's laughter, questions about things we've done - not Ravnica, but elsewhere. Taz does songs; he even shows us a strange sort of minor illusion, like a low frame-rate movie, of the first seconds after activation - Zorbu's up-close face, then turning his head to see the three of us and Rerdian stood behind. He says, "I've been saving this for a special time."

Fee-Ree and Arxcis say they'll go for a walk; Fee-Ree has given him his sending stone. **We agree to converge at Nivix later, since we'll be on site until the Disruptor components are in the air**.

It's about 8:30. We say goodbye and amble out, the three of us chatting. Gnog figures there are just a few moments in life he wishes he could "bottle" and revisit over and over; that was one of them. We can't think of anything much productive (!) to do before meeting at Nivix, so we go our old haunt of the nearby drinking/eating area in P4. A couple of zinos later on snacks and drinks, we've caught up with old friends, avoided talking "shop"; and we learn, surprisingly, that Ravnica was actually the name of the city that became D10, as it merged into the planet-wide city and Ravnica as a planet is actually named *after* it. People don't remember what the planet used to be called.

Around 10pm, we head to Nivix. It's still super busy, in fact busier if anything. They've been in touch with Aurelia and Aurelio, with tactical information exchanged. Things are almost ready at Nivix. The garrison needs a few hours to be set up and ready. They suggest that, if we're coming, we get a few hours of sleep if we can! "At this point in time, we are expecting to send Thopters up under cover of darkness before the dawn. We need to be able to see somewhat, but don't need full daylight; the pre-dawn hours are when most people are asleep so we're less likely to be spotted".

We're told to take the Night Watch quarters, near the entrance to the sky lobby; we can fit three of us in there. They'll be on watch so we can rest in there (and Taz can stand). In a moment of good timing, Fee-Ree arrives not long later; around 10:30pm we're up in the room and try to sleep.



## Day 50 (Ravnica 30, Riglan 87 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Saturday (7 day week)

We are at Nivix. It's day 3 into 'future goes black'. We've just about had a long rest, given that the previous day wasn't physically strenuous; DM fiat. Not only are we brought coffee to help wake us up, but we also learn nothing bad happened overnight. Minor miracle.

It's only been some 6 1/2 ish hours since we slept - it's 5am. A hive of activity, again. Ral is there, tired but wired on coffee! Gibo and Bebe are there, along with many other goblins. Thopters are being hooked up to crates. We ask what we can do to help. Gibo and Bebe don't know how to fly Thopters aren't not going up (we're relieved, it's dangerous up there) but are helping with strapping things down; we're asked to assist with various holding, tying and other miscellaneous tasks - e.g. holding up a Thopter wing so a goblin can get their arm into a wing strap. The Thopters have a small power source, but need steering; goblins pilot them; more agility than fully automated craft, which are available but just fly in straight lines between two points. They're small craft, maybe 5x5ft footprint.

Ral is (rightly, we suspect!) nervous, as is his deputy. They've been up all night. Many checklists on clipboards, checked and double-checked. And so it goes on, moments of panic as something is thought missed but then found, then there's a final comparison of checklists. It's a veritable armada of Thopters! 24, one per angel, all lined up and ready to go, carrying in total some 50 crates - but they only carry 48, so there are two spare boxes. Can we help? Well, yes, we can fly; we'd be a little slower but can do so. Gnog and Fee-Ree have to carry a crate each; Deni and Taz will just be able to fly. Trouble is - it takes longer than 10 minutes to get up there.

In the end with come up a wild plan - L5 Fly for everyone except Taz, he uses the dulcimer; when 10 minutes is almost up, we get close and Fee-Ree burns her only L6 for a 4-person Fly for the rest of the trip up.

Everything is just about ready. Off in the distance, from Sunhome, a light flares twice; Ral's assistant says it's the signal for the angels. "To the air! To the air!"

Thopter goblins run to the edges of platforms and dive off; 6 per side; we cast our spells and lift off, Gnog and Fee-Ree hold crates, Deni has her bow drawn and Taz is ready with mandolin and other tricks to adopt a defensive posture. Gnog plans to literally physically meat-shield Fee-Ree if need be. Pulling up alongside, the squadron of angels; they split and start making rotating patrols ahead, behind and around. An orbiting perimeter around a ball of Thopters.

A few minutes in, a few angels on one side split off; swords are drawn and light on fire; 6 angels form a hexagon formation heading out to a large, black shape that seems to be a flying shadow; **it is a Death Pact angel** - angels that have gained some semblance of free will, just as we fought once in the Red Wastes. The six engage immediately. We suspect Orzhovian sources. At the rear, a back-up squadron that had been flying behind in reserve fills in the defensive gap. We're not close enough to throw anything at the Death Pact angel. 

**Two large winged creatures with riders are spotted. Drakes? Riders throw bolts of shadow out**. Angels throw up shields. A lead battle angel calls out, "They're coming for us! Close in and form the shell!"

The angels come in close; shields overlap; it's a near-complete shell that defends the side upon which we are being attacked, but this exposes the other flank; a final back-up squadron flies in to try and fill it. We can see we're being bombarded, from many directions now, angels reacting as best they can. We're half way through the journey - Fee-Ree yells, we have to group  up; we do so; she casts L6 Fly on us all just as her other spell is fading. Taz waited a moment before his mandolin casting to give him a few seconds leeway. No wild magic surges! "To our places!" she calls.

Gnog tries to position himself between the largest inbound assault and Fee-Ree, physically. Taz and Deni split off, looking for targets. Taz starts throwing out Eldritch Blasts as soon as he has range on a target; Deni throws arrows. We see ghosts, or spectres (Harry Potter death eater stylee) emerge from clouds and scream towards us. Angels are engaging on all sides. Little holes appear in the defence; spells try to be thrown into them whenever that happens.

Some panic is happening. Taz uses the Mizzium Apparatus to cast - *just!, with BFS!* - Motivational Speech. He bolsters a few, and this spreads out; he continues to play, throwing out Guidance to any that seem to need it. He flies ahead, casting See Invisibility, seeing if he can clear the way; it makes it easier to spot spectres; Eldritch Blasts throw constantly, to deter at anything he sees at all. Deni pulls up the rear and releases arrows at any chasers; we're trying to force attacks to the "tube" / around the circumference that the angels are better able to cover. There are some fierce battles at distance here and there as the angels draw damage away from us as best they can. Deni's going through arrows at a hell of a rate, none recoverable now.

We're getting closer. Flaring light and sunbeams sear out at groups of strange, giant, spectral insects that were clustering and swarming in front; Aurelio's group has seen is coming - indeed seen the battle from a long way away - and they have some casters who can help. A lot of shadow creatures. Probably Orzhov, but a worrying hint of Dimir. Our "bait ball", surrounded by sharks, make it up to the platform. Many angels are somewhat injured but about 6 are quite badly hurt. They land while the others form a perimeter to help the Thopters land - they can't all land at once and have to spread out. Taz lands amidst the most hurt angels and casts Mass Cure Wounds (L5); he gets a great roll (3d8 -> 6,8,8) for a whopping 27 healing on everyone within the 30ft range. This helps a lot and all angels are able to get back into the fight.

Thopters land two at a time. Gnog is down and has put down his crate; he's helping Fee-Ree; we're now looking for how we can help get things to their required ground locations as quickly as possible. Aurelio's guards are lined up, watching the skies; eventually, all are landed near the memorial garden, a good open area.

It was a harrowing almost-15-minutes after we started being attacked. People are tired; many angels are tapped out on abilities. Watch is being kept all the same; some have to rest; attacks are more sporadic now that the Thopters are down. It was a very coordinated, well considered attack; surgical and tactical, timed carefully. The Thopters were too far away to turn around, in the "middle third" and they knew we'd commit to continuing. Without the air support we'd have been screwed.

Creatures attacking were varied; all flying; of shadow or spectral, perhaps intended to have an element of surprise, but angels can see all that clearly. We are worried that the Boros might be disadvantaged on the platform, but they have Lanterns Of Revealing. They're well prepared.

### 3000 XP divided as 1500 each and 3000+4500 to Taz

Goblins start to unpack. Engineers stay, but pilots have to take the Thopters back. The engineer goblins will need to return in an airship. They've organised a small airship separately. Taz tries to persuade angels to help, but (nat 1 -> 14! + BFS -> 16) they're exhausted; they do agree to escort pilots back to Nivix. Two teams will stay on the platform too (4 angels). The airship will have Boros support from the ground anyway; besides, Gnog says that perhaps it's too obvious a signal that an airship is important.

We are invited to set up camp with Aurelio's Boros crew, with a separate group on permanent patrol on watch at the weather station. We set up camp as directed.

Dawn breaks. A beautiful sight; it hits the platform before anywhere else around. Patchy clouds, yellow-white. With the rising of the sun, the remaining sporadic attacks cease. Gnog sees the inbound airship coming out of Augustin Station far away.

Equipment and people are unloaded; some head for the restaurant, but a bevvy of humans, vedalken and goblin engineers disembark too. The rest of the Boros legion have squeezed into the same airship and disembark last. There are now almost 60 soldiers here, plus ourselves and the four angels. Aurelio has set 8 hour watches; 6am-2pm, 2pm-10pm, 10pm-6am.

Aurelio hasn't missed a thing - groups of wait staff come up from the restaurant with huge pots of coffee. A good feeling around the camp; cookies and coffee are shared, conversation is had, Taz plays. The first watch changes and the first off-watch soldier group head to sleep.

Deni points out she's low on arrows; we ask Aurelio, and he has a munitions store. Deni is able to replenish her quiver. We elect to sweep the platform from metaphorical stem to stern. Deni has good investigation skills. Taz too, but he rolls badly - 6,9+5 with BFS only adding 1 - 15 total. We don't see anything particularly troubling. The Boros have, after all, swept through already. It gave us something to do! It takes about 40 minutes in practice; the platform doesn't have too many buildings outside the restaurant.

Fee-Ree makes breakfast. Cinnamon, raisin and nut oatmeal-like porridge, with some of Levinia's honey added. It's great! It reminds us of being on the road. Taz hasn't had this particular kind of porridge before and enjoys tasting it.

Gnog sends a paper bird to Elias, who we'd helped a while ago with healing around P4; warning him to keep an eye out for Selesnyans guiding people below, and to move anyone he can as it's a legitimate thing and definitely worth following down with whoever can make it. Only 3 left now. Then we head over to the old weather station to check in with Ral, since we still think the power station is the most important thing to guard.

A small contingent of Boros are here to help. We'll hang around here to bolster it as long as we can. Ral is directing engineers; it takes a while to put things together, as big components had to be broken down and need complex reassembly. It feels somehow chaotic. Gnog checks in with Ral; can help assert some order, or is Ral OK with the scattered approach?

"Well if you know your way around a magnetocore and inverse flux generator stabilisation rig, that would be very helpful because we need a few extra pairs of hands on that rig there!" - well, Taz is at least dextrous and can learn, so Taz heads over. Intelligence with tinker's tools proficiency, 14+3+4, 21; some of his innate programming recognises parallels with his own construction and he's able to take direction in any case, but doesn't need to be babysat through every step. Fee-Ree assists with Mending when she can. Deni remains on lookout; she basically disappears for a while. Gnog helps lifting things! Strength check 17+11. We make a material difference, surprisingly; Ral thought it'd take at least 2 hours to get things installed but it takes little more than 1 in the end.

By 8:30am, Ral is ready to test the power system. Gnog observes people *closely* for any out-of-the-ordinary behaviour. Nat 4 then 18 luck point perception; 26. Some engineers look very worried! They hang around on the fringes. A couple of people we do not recognise, who are watching from a distance, we're up on the weather station and they are below. Taz and Gnog enquire with a worried engineer; why so worried? They're short of a couple of cables! But they *think* it's OK... And it'd be a big delay to fetch the cables and pull things apart to install them.

Next, Gnog and Taz head down to speak to the observers. They watch warily. "Good morning!" says Gnog cheerfully. They ask what we're doing. "Exciting Nivix experiment! Power systems. Related to the weather. Are you from the restaurant?" "We're from the caretakers". Insight 12, are they truthful? Seem to be. We try to make comforting noises! They say, "Well, as long as you guys are as careful as the guys who were up here before, that's OK." Gnog asks about them. "2 days ago! Pretty loud. They brought all their machines up here?" "What did they look like? I was always interested in that group but never knew much about them..." "Well, just machines..." "No, I mean the people!" "Oh! Hard to say. Maybe 2 humans and a dozen constructs. All over the weather station, and even down in the connectors too. Even went down to the control room, but they said they mainly needed the connectors - the places where the anchor points from the ground attach." "Well, good to know they were careful and we'll try to do the same!"

We head off, Gnog trying not to run, get up to Ral and whisper in his ear, "Trouble. Don't test. Need somewhere to talk."

Ral has everyone re-check everything. The guy we'd spoken to who was worried finds a cable and takes the opportunity to make changes.

We let Ral know about the mystery people. He'll check the weather station and control room; he assigns a person to us - in fact the same engineer, **Jacobi**, we'd spoken to before! - as we're going check all the connection points. Gnog asks Deni if she wants to stay or come with; she'll come. We check a platform map and head for the nearest chain connector. We head there. Huge pylons, with hefty pulleys, winches and more.

We start investigating the mechanical parts, at Jacobi's recommendation. We need to climb to check them. Gnog helps carry Taz up; Jacobi is OK climbing. Taz helps Jacobi check things out. Jacobi investigation adv., nat 20! Mechanically it is fine, no loose pins or anything else that stands out - BUT - someone has been here to install "improvements". He says he doesn't think they understood the purpose of certain power relays but there used to be dampeners on them that control... (and basically describes a mechanism to stop power falling too high or low)... They could draw an unbounded amount of energy. He quite admires the modification. It would be easy to reinstate the original flow - and without asking gets to work. Taz assists with tinker's tools, but only gets 14 on assist; he at least casts Guidance on Jacobi. Jacobi rolls really badly too! They don't *break* things but it takes ages to figure out. Jacobi even asks if one us wouldn't mind running back to base camp and getting a particular manual from a particular tent. Deni is the fastest and fetches the relevant guide.

We have to spend a while tending to the remaining four connection points. This takes a good chunk of the morning. It gets easier with practice. Finally, we get back to Ral and let him know, around 11am, with everything rebuilt and they're waiting. We tell him we're done; they've already checked the control room and found nothing. Start the test!

D100 - <= 50, bad, else good - rolled a 51!

The equipment powers up. The platform actually shakes! This alarms quite a few people obviously... But the test is successful. Ral asks us to let the control room that everything is OK! The restaurant staff tell us that all the lights went out... Hmm, a "little bit of power just to get started", said Ral! Even the control room guy said the same thing, as if a pulse went out interfering with all energy. It interfered with propulsion - the platform shuddered because, basically, it momentarily slightly fell.

We get back to Ral; he's aware! It's the nature of the test; instead of the disruptor firing a beam, it's just a "ping", a pulse that goes out in all directions.

It's close to lunchtime. Back at camp, it's a buzz of activity as lunch is being made. We need to find a way to keep an eye on both sides. Around 12:30, food is ready, but that's just in camp - people at the weather station aren't getting this. We take a few bowls that way. The Nivix people have their own lunch but the Boros patrol is grateful. We head back and eat ourselves.

Around 1:30-2pm patrols start to switch over to the next shift. Lunch is run for a full two hours to have some overlap with the shifts; it's a form of breakfast for some, supper for others!

Aurelio comes off-shift. We check in. He says people are in reasonable spirits but a bit on edge, since we don't know exactly when or what is coming. Those who were coming onto watch were already awake; they'd come up the day before. The ones who just finished came up first thing this morning.

Aurelio offers to wander around with us. We don't really know what to look for! Nobody hiding in any buildings (investigation 15). A couple of drunk love birds in one building! Harmless enough. Next up, we spend some time getting to know the caretakers and learning who they are. One recognises Gnog - history nat 20+1! - he was the caretaker sharing a room with the other who Tesseret killed. We have to break it to him that the other guy passed away but obfuscate details of why to avoid undue distress. With Taz assisting, Gnog persuasion 19+7 -> 26, we do get the guy on side.

Eventually we get familiar enough to pluck up courage for Gnog to come clean about what's really going on. We confess that we don't strictly know for sure if the other caretaker is dead - Kaya only saw the goblin cast over - and don't mention our suspicions that if he's alive, he must be with Tesseret!

They complain about the Izzit "running amok". We try to alleviate concerns by saying we'll speak to Ral, but they complain about their store rooms being used - what?! We ask for clarification and they tell us about one store room where crates were being placed by an Izzit League member (or so they think). We do not expect this and while it might be legit we want to check that out ASAP. They describe a tall, quite dark-skinned human, standard Izzit dress - blue and red - had a little shoulder bag - carrying boxes, into the store room and moving their stuff out.

Deni stays to watch the storeroom while we return to talk to Ral. Ral doesn't think anyone should be doing that. We start to check stock; some crystals are missing. Dammit. It's about 3pm. We are considering fetching Aurelio to let him that there is an internal security problem. As we are deliberating solutions - a warn horn blows! "To arms!" There's something in the sky. We run to the storeroom where Deni was waiting. During that time, battle has started on the platform. Sounds of battle are coming from the Boros area. We quickly check inside the store room - a group of six boxes. Gnog perception 16; the sound of feet running, swords clashing, full-on battle. We close the door and run into the fray.

On approach, we see wild drakes. The look strangely un-Ravnican! The riders seem gaunt, not zombies but maybe wights; a few have clouded-over, white eyes. They carry jagged-looking halberds and do fly buys to assault the main garden installation. The Boros are trying to use fires to knock them out of the sky. The four angels are engaging, but we can tell they're tired. One gets speared and falls; one goes their aid. A fair bit of chaos. Some Izzit are hiding, some protecting equipment, some slinging spells and so-on. The Boros are ground-based trying to defend equipment while angels try to deal with the attack from the air. There are around 12 of these drakes!

There are three main pieces of equipment, roughly forming a triangle with 60ft distant corners. Fee-Ree, Deni and Taz each take a corner; Gnog runs to the middle; four Drakes sweep down to attack him. 

Within 20ft, Gnog jump/flies and swipes twice. One hit one crit. Crit damage is a little low but it's overall 56 damage to the rider. The wight is severely injured but still up.

Taz is near a downed angel, being aided by his friend. Perception 17+3; the damage is severe, necrotic or corrosive somehow. It's a life-sapping thing. "Watch out!" shouts the angel; Taz looks up and sees an inbound drake - 3 eldritch blasts at the rider. Sort of half cover; only one hit; only 12 damage. Taz throws bardic inspiration at the stricken angel on the ground. The drake comes in to attack Taz with a halberd. Taz deflects that; the drake tries to attack too; Taz avoids being grappled. As the drake flies by an Izzit League lighting bolt hits, searing both drake and rider.

Two drakes and riders engage Gnog. The first misses - rider and drake; the second rider misses too but the drake gets in its claws. Gnog athl adv 24 (vs 25). Despite that roll, Gnog is grappled. On his turn, athl adv 28; he escapes. He flies back to the ground.

Taz has another drake in view. This time he goes for the drake; easier to hit; all three hit for high damage rolls totalling 42 (14, 14, 14!). It veers off instead of attacking further.

Gnog sees that the Izzit have set up a canon; they're telling him to watch out and keep his head down! As the fourth drake comes towards him, the canon is fired; the ground shakes; a huge soundwave bursts out, like thunder, hitting the drake square on. It crashes down onto the ground in front of Gnog, disorientated. Gnog tries to grab the rider. Unarmed strike good roll, 26. Pull the wight off the drake pin it to the ground. Adv athl 9+10; he's slammed to the ground; damage via DM considered d6+6 but d6 only 1, so only 7 damage. The drake gets up and tries to attack Gnog. Well, they're not acting independently then! It deals 11->5 damage. Con save 23, poison 12->6->3 damage.

The other angel has risen up to engage again with drakes above. Taz notices that the halberds seem to cause the necrotic damage to the angels. He shouts a warning about that; bardic inspiration to this angel too; he fires at the rider of the drake. None of them hit, but one does strike the drake for 11.

This kind of thing goes on "for a few rounds". Gnog keeping the guy on the ground, trying to defend from other drake attacks; lightning attacks from Izzit get more accurate and the large canon brings down three other riders; four down; after a while, others beat a hasty retreat. One installation is pulled out of the ground but repairable.

Gnog shouts to his party, "Weather station, right now!" and see what's going on there - was the other attack a distraction? Ral is on top with a lieutenant; there are scorch marks on the roof, equipment is fine, a shimmering globe of invulnerability surrounding the tower. Other aggressors have also left.

Now back to the store house. The crates are gone, of course; the attack was a distraction. A window of opportunity to make off with them. Deni is uninjured; Fee-Ree a little; Taz used a couple of his protective wings from Garren to fend off attacks. Gnog perception even with Taz helping, 7 and 7 again, total 15. He can see that the crates were put outside from indentations in the ground. Probably flown out? Flattened grass suggests a lot of downward wind - beating wings - drops of blood too. We investigate that; no use, 4+3 medicine. Someone was bleeding here but there wasn't a fight.

We get hold of Aurelio. How are we doing? One angel is very badly injured, another not great either. Both must retreat. They leave the platform and say they'll see if anyone else can be sent up, though. The Boros have some injured; they will try using off-shift rests to recover. We ask Aurelio if he can spare a few more people to take over to the weather station because we have this vague description of a person to round up. A couple of guards are summoned.

We ask for Ral's help finding people that match the description. It takes the rest of the afternoon, because everyone's busy mending broken equipment and so-on. By about 6pm we figure out that whoever it was is no longer there. They once again succeed. We do have enough crystals left, *JUST*, but no more.

Later, Gnog perception 22. Ral is exhausted. Gnog insists that Ral rest! He has 2 points of exhaustion. Ral sets up a cot *in* the weather station, downstairs. We head back to our own camp and sort out dinner. It's well past 6pm. Dinner guests for the evening shift are arriving in airships. A perimeter is established, caretakers and the Boros working together to help avoid having diners basically be escorted by armed guards to and from their airship!

While Gnog would prefer perhaps to have things closed down at this point, but the Boros think the only way to do that would be to basically declare Boros martial law on the platform. Gnog thinks this would just give the Azorius an excuse to kick us off the platform, so elects to not go with that option.

It's about 7pm.

We can't afford another internal security breach. Boros soldiers rostered off duty but not sleeping are now rostered on to guarding crates and equipment.

At 8pm during the change of the guard, of all people, War Leader Aurelia flies up - she brings two more angels. "It's all hands on deck - today we had full Boros defence out on the ground because there were all-out attacks on the ground anchor points of the platform. Whatever is happening, people *really* do not want what you're doing up here to happen." We thank her for the angels and ask if the other two were OK - they'll be fine. Looking to Taz, she says, "It looks like this is what we have in the days to come - big acts of bravery will be needed from seemingly small forces, but nothing is insignificant. Everyone has role to play. Never more has this been true as it is now".

Extra garrisons have been posted at the anchor points below. We'd better keep an eye up top. She thinks that whatever's going on down there, it's building to a crescendo. She has *never* known of this level of outward attacking and misbehaviour, not for decades (implying the Decamillennial Celebrations).

She thinks whatever this attack is, it must be soon. She thinks they're behaving desperately; these in-shadow forces are now attacking openly, in the day. She recognises both on-world Ravnican and off-world elements. She concurs that the riders don't line up to anything she knows of on-world - after all, we have one dead wight that Gnog killed. Definitely off-world.

Gnog uses the four-way sending stone; "Multiple attacks on platform. Some equipment lost but we are functional. Have yet to confirm undercity availability with Golgari. Your status?"

* Nissa says "Selesnyans defending platform anchor point in Precinct 3. Escalation of attacks; military mobilised. Exploring paths to safety for populus" (19).

* Kaya says "Tonight's The Night" (3).

* Ajani says "Victory is ours! We have vanquished the rogue elements of Nikya. Domri raid pushed back to wilderness. The day is ours. Glorious victory shall be -" (25).

"At least he's upbeat", remarks Fee-Ree; while Deni wants to know what glorious victory shall be!

Taz has to use Sending to Vraska. "Situation approaching critical. Dimir have agreed to help you, but need time. Were you able to get Kraul agreement for undercity access?"

The reply is simply, "Working on it. Looking optimistic. No small amount of turmoil down here. The insects are spooked about something. Possible tremors late this morning." (Oops, that was probably us!)

Eventually, we finally sleep, taking watch in turns. Taz assists throughout.

* Fee-Ree perception high
* Deni perception high
* Gnog perception 12+8->20
* Taz 19+3->22... and see below...



## Day 51 (Ravnica 31, Riglan 88 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Sunday (7 day week)

...at about 5:30am, just before the full dawn, Taz sees a slight "churning" in the clouds and a bright flare goes up over Nivix. Someone yells. The whole camp stirs; all the Izzet go running to stations. Taz wakes up the party.

Gnog asks the four angels to fly back to the weather station to defend there and we stand our ground at the gardens. Izzit are charging up their equipment. It's feeding energy to the weather station and Gnog realises that perhaps **this is the bridge opening**!

The flare above Nivix pulses a few times, then a beam of light heads out, pointing at a position in the sky, following a trace downwards, then eventually stopping just above the Chamber of the Guild Pact. The churning cloud in the sky has descended and starts to part. From where we are, we can see that lights on the weather station are all illuminated. We can see people nearby rotating the three pieces of triangulated equipment to point to the same position. Hovering above the Chamber Of The Guild Pact, is what now seems to be a churning tear in reality. As it parts, a bright sun-scorched landscape is visible. Taz shouts in horror, **"That's Amonkhet!"** and we see huge pillars, of some kind of gate witha portal; Taz continues, "The main temple we saw!". Beyond are arrayed legions of an army, spread down stairs and columns of the main temple, along the causeway of a city; 25-30ft tall giant gods?! are visible with hawk heads, one with a cobra head and so-on walk behind, corralling the army.

Gnog looks back to the weather station. He can see Ral signalling something. The disruptor is fired! A pulse is directed from the weather station down to the three things on the ground, which seem to be some kind of amplifiers; it happens very quickly; the pulse is calibrated to have all three rays converge on the opening gate.

It's like hitting the surface of water; there's a ripple, on the other side, it seems as if armies are pushed back by some kind of wave of force. The clouds on our side seem to be sucked in as if a vacuum and the gate closes, just like that! Gnog notices that various lights in the district down below had gone out but are now coming back on.

**There's a moment of silence and then the entire platform erupts in cheers.**

Gnog tries to shout through the noise after a moment of celebration, "Keep on your posts! They might try again!" - and at that moment, another flare goes up. The guide light points back to the same place. The churning cloud reappears as the platform mood changes in dismay. Lights on the weather station illuminate again, more of the same sounds of building power; lights in the city below flicker. There's almost an extrusion of reality as if a literal physical bridge was pushing through; it clips the top of the Chamber of the Guild Pact and masonry and statues are thrown aside, crashing to the ground. The disruptor, having taken longer to recharge, fires and hits; the portal shakes and implodes once more, but bits of masonry are left behind that are clearly not from Ravnica. They crash down over the roof of the Chamber.

This time there's just quiet - everyone is waiting with baited breath, then there is a flurry of activity as things are checked and re-checked; the weather station continues to build power again this time, not shutting down at all. Aside from the power hum from the weather station, you could hear a pin drop.

The same time - about 6 minutes - another flare from Nivix. A different location though. No light to guide the way; then someone sees the cloud is appearing above Nivix itself. The portal starts to open again there. The emitters are being turned; it seems painfully slow but they're getting there; this time the soldiers at the gate aren't waiting, they're rushing and many - 100 or so - *fall out* of the portal in the sky onto the roof of Nivix. The disruptor fires; once more the portal closes but we see significant physical damage to the gate beyond, big parts of it falling. Nivix is slightly damaged and swarming with undead warriors on the roof, falling over the building side and down to the ground. Arcs of lightning and firebolts start to be visible down there as battle breaks out.

A message comes up from Ral - they can't fire again - they've pulled too much power. We have to hope that we did enough damage.

A very tense 6 minutes. 6 more. 15 minutes. Nothing. The battle around Nivix quietens. As dawn breaks, we can see thopters and various people making repairs there.

On the platform there's a collective sigh of relief. Ral won't leave his post. 8 hours to recharge fully. Taz heads over, gets to Ral, **casts Greater Restoration**. Ral says it's better than coffee! Gnog gives last wine bottle to Ral & team: "Whatever else happens after this, the disruptor worked. The Izzit gave Ravnica another day and another chance."

The sun rises over a changed Ravnica. *Now* there's evidence to persuade people to evacuate when the call comes!

Gnog asks Taz to use Sending to Lavaz of the Dimir. "Bolas attacks have commenced, as you probably know! Retrieving memory of Vraska now urgent; is it possible?"

The reply is swift. "Yes. We have established necessary safeguards and agents to perform procedure. Please bring her to the library and check in room 16 tonight."

OK, so we need to get down to the surface tonight. Right now the angels and soldiers are quite strong and Bolas' forces may need time to plan a new attack, which might even happen on the ground anyway. We decide to take an airship down to the station, then walk down to the Golgari and Vraska to speak to her in person.

Shortly after this, another message is received - this time by Fee-Ree. It's Jace. She tell us that he's said, "The assault has begun, evidently. Turmoil and chaos in Precinct 1. Orzhov need to be dealt with! Azorius aiding them. I sense crossroads ahead. Jace." and Fee-Ree responds, "We will see if we can assist Kaya." We assume that Jace is able to tell others what is going on. Gnog uses the four-way sending stone; "Three portals from Bolas disrupted. Damage on his end, but more surely coming. We are expediting an issue with Vraska and intend to assist Kaya."

* Ajani says, "Never fear. On my way in. I won't be far. Will check in with Boros upon my return and assume we are congregating at Nivix..."
* No response from Nissa or Kaya.

We let Ral and Aurelio know we're headed down and on the first morning airship, to descend back to the surface. It's empty, nobody else coming down (it was bringing staff up). We ask the two staff (not the pilot, who's busy) what the reaction is. Completely crazy, basically! They're surprised to have flown; they don't know how long flights will be allowed to continue. There are rumours Augustin Station and the platform might get shut down in light of attacks. They're quite scared.

At touchdown, we see an unwelcome heavy Azorius presence at Augustin Station. They're checking everyone coming on or off the platform. We're asked what our business has been on the platform. We answer honestly; we're pulled into an area set aside for questioning. We are asked if we were responsible in any way for the beams that were sent out of the platform; we say no, we weren't responsible for that equipment. We're told we can go, but we ask what the issue is; they're of course claiming that it was the *beams* that damaged the Chamber of the Guild Pact, and are considering it a terrorist act. We leave.

Gnog asks Taz level 3 to Ral. "Azorius now fully corrupt. Trying to blame your beams for damage. Considering it terrorism. Prepare to defend yourselves. Augustin Station likely to be closed." Ral answers, "We will stay put in that case! Alternative situations need to be explored, clearly. Will keep that in mind. Will ride by Thopter if needed."

We decide we need to get to Sunhome to keep up the charm offensive and dispel these vicious rumours! It's an awkward and long route to avoid Precinct 1. In Whitestone, P2, Gnog perception 15+8->23; he notices that people outside cafés and walking in streets are gossiping. It's interesting - many people *saw* the gate, and saw to Amonkhet; they noticed the beams after, closing it. But it depends on how many saw it. Others have the opposing view and tow the Azorius line. The trouble is that the Izzit have a bad track record! Even so, it's not 100% yet. That's good for loosening Azorius control, but bad for being yet another way to divide Ravnica and cause dissent.

We turn a corner and heading towards Selesnya, up ahead, a bright flash of light and loud clatter - someone flying about 15ft up, long blue and white ribbons trailing behind; a large robe that looks almost like a kimono; behind, a trail of bright flashes; Taz arcana 2+11, recognises a spell he knows; Hypnotic Pattern is being cast behind! They're trying to *run away* from Azorious law mages running after - well, her. "Halt! Halt! You are breaking law <some law number> as an undocumented alien" - and she responds in a different language, Taz Comprehend Languages - he recites, "What brutes. I'm here because I was called to help! Stop attacking me! Calm down! Do not make me hurt you!" so Gnog asks Taz to cast Minor Illusion - a picture of Vi's face and an arrow pointing to us. "These people just started attacking me out of nowhere! They tried to cast Hold Person! So rude!"

Taz uses the Dulcimer to cast Invisibility on her then Gnog shouts as loudly as he can, "Oh my! Look! She portaled away!" - Gnog with luck point deception 14, with Taz adding Guidance for an extra 2. 16 total. "What? No, we saw her go this way! She's just gone invisible! Out of our way citizen!" and one of the scans Gnog. We step to one side and let them run past, calling for reinforcements.

Taz casts See Invisibility and waves at the newcomer. He uses Minor Illusion to show the four of us as dots walking, then with her following (she nods) and says "we need to get somewhere private quickly" to the group. An illusory bird from the newcomer appears, and heads off in a different direction. We make a beeline for the P3 Selesnyan nearest entrypoint. We encounter a border check. Gnog says, "We're five. One of us invisible. Vital to the effort on the platform which disrupted the three attacks from Nicol Bolas this morning. Requesting sanctuary." - and one stands, thinks for a minute (with the collective) - then asks us to come in immediately.

As we're just about to go in, the Azorius turn and point, seeing the newcomer - we've taken 10 minutes, she's visible again! - but we cross the threshold and the Selesnyans close ranks to prevent access as we run inside.

Once inside, Gnog asks, "Do you speak Common?"

She thinks quizzically then she casts some kind of spell - it seems to be Tongues, since she can now speak our language. "I am pleased to meet you. I did have that under control, thank you very much though. My name is **Mu Yanling**. I responded to Vi's call. It is a pleasure to meet you. You may call me **Yanling**. Others know me as **Grand Library of the Cosmos**."

Gnog says, "An honour. We apologise for our ignorance of your language. Ravnica is falling apart; Nicol Bolas has corrupted most guilds to some degree, but sadly, the Azorius lawmakers seem lost..." - and as we're saying this, magical huge scrolls appear behind her and animated quills start writing down what we're saying! - "...this morning, three inter-planar bridges to carry his undead army were thwarted by the platform beacon of the Izzit, but the Azorius are trying to call it at terrorist attack, saying the beams did the damage. The platform will need defending."

"The truth is always a fragile thing, anywhere in the cosmos. There must be those willing to defend it. I am a neutral observer; that is my role; but I cannot sit by and watch Bolas wreak havoc on another world."

Gnog says, "Niv Mizzet of this world believes this is the last stand. If Bolas wins here, he would be able to consume enough magic to be unstoppable by any entity in the universe."

"That theory bears some weight... We have debated this at great length at the Grand Archive in the centre of the Multiverse. There are many who believe we must not interfere. I bear the scars on my conscience of sitting back and doing nothing as we saw him devour the plane of Amonkhet. I simply cannot continue to do so. This may cost me the title I have held for centuries as Grand Librarian, but at least this is a decision I can live with."

Taz says, "I have seen Amonkhet. I have seen the horror. I could not imagine a creature who knew of such things, but did nothing, as being anything other than evil..." (She looks hurt) "...but you have chosen differently; at great personal cost, perhaps" "Perhaps too late?" "Oh, no, it's never too late! We all wrestle with difficult decisions and they can take time. Your decision aligns with mine. My opinions are mine alone. But I am glad you are here." "We take a vow of neutrality at the archive, but there is a school of philosophy that says 'to stand back and do nothing when the balance is clearly tipped in one direction or another is to acquiesce and align oneself with the actor through our inaction'. The other philosophy stands that, 'if we do not obstruct the ways and acts that people identify as Good, then surely we must not obstruct the ways and acts that people identify as Evil." Taz responds, "That makes sense, right up until the evil is so strong, that it would destroy *you* and your organisation and must as everything else." "Yes, I think, perhaps I was never as neutral as I purported to be..."

Gnog says, "We can offer at least temporary safe harbour either here, or on the Decamillennial Platform, the latter being a battleground to protect the disruptor equipment there."

"I shall seek out Vi immediately, and head to the battle ground of which you speak if that is where the action is! Will you please point me in the direction of this plane's storytellers and historians, such that I might fill in the gaps of my knowledge?"

We show her maps & give directions for P3 storytellers, P5 library and P6 for Vi. She fishes out a small pink crystal, holding it out to Taz. "This is a thought crystal. Hold it and think of me; you can send short messages that I can hear and speak to you through it. It is keyed only to me." It can be used as often as possible. He thanks her; very useful!

"Farewell my new friends. I will see you again very soon!" and she flies off.

We take stock. The Selesnyans have clearly mobilised. We elect to not disturb Nissa and make our way across to Sunhome, but soon bump into her in P3 anyway. We tell her about the new friend. We ask how she's getting on. "Well, Selesnyan is a buzz; everyone woke up at 5:30 this morning because the scouts and the sentries saw what was happening. It was frightening, but we cheered when that first one was closed; but then horrified when the second opened and truly horrified at the third opening. Selesnyan forces rushed over to wards Nivix to try and help."

The conversation goes on; we hope to avoid all-out war but it seems less likely now.

Seeing the Selesnyans mobilised is quite something. The huge, dinosaur-like animals are set up almost like mobile fortresses. Huge rhinos pull wheeled forts. They can really move a lot of people, with defence. "If we cannot accommodate people below", adds Nissa, "the Selesnyans can move at least a quarter of this entire district into the Red Wastes and defend them." Another option is good to have.

We bid farewell and cut across to Sunhome. It's inevitably near-chaos here, as much as it ever could be in something this regimented. The Transguild Promenade is more or less locked down; many people are gawking at the damage to Nivix. We figure we'll at least try to get to Feather but it'll take a while to get through everything.

Taz adv persuasion 4,19+13->32 - the investigator pin helps! - internal affairs and all that. Feather's department is of course on full alert. Feather isn't in her office, instead amongst the staff, helping. We get talking. Augustin Station likely to be closed at midday today. The Boros can't get control of the platform anchor points in P1 or P2 and they're *trying* to keep the station open at least until midday *tomorrow* via an old byelaw about not closing platform access without 24h notice. They've been analysing the undead that fell through the gate. It's **Lazotep** armour that was being mined; whoever is in it is impervious to attack until the armour itself is broken first.

We ask if there is anything else to bolster platform defence, it would be welcome but realise things are max capacity on multiple fronts here. We will check in with Niv to find out if losing the P1 and/or P2 anchor points would be a critical problem or if the platform would survive. Feather knows it would be unstable, but not actually fall or drift fully. Feather things the P1 point is perhaps more defensible, especially if the Orzhov don't interfere. Since we are trying to work on that angle, we suggest that perhaps she pull resources away from P2's point and redistribute those resources.

We figure Jace needs to get out of the Chamber, confront the Azorius directly.

We head away and over to Nivix next, to try and talk to Niv (but we know that Ral and Ral's 2iC are on the platform). It's about 10am by the time we get to the sky lobby. There's a familiar face here, arguing - it's Ajani! We greet him and remind them that if they see this guy, it's all good. After a brief catch-up, Ajani strides off agreeing to meet Niv. But how? He can't operate it. He tries asking some goblins. None of the goblins can help, obviously... Well, actually, after much discussion, they *do* know where to find today's code to activate the circle, but who has the spell?

Taz has it - if he uses the Mizzium Apparatus, with Teleportation Circle being L5. He'd need Arcana 20 to make that work - he has a +11, but that's pretty much 50:50. Built For Success and Bless from Ajani add D4s, but it's still very high risk as we'd all be in the circle when he tried the casting.

After much worry - Taz tries it - nat 15 + 11 Arcana. It works beautifully! We find ourselves in Niv's chamber.

He says "Things are very bad!" when he sees us. No shit! After some convo, we ask him to see if he can get Jace to confront the Azorius and use his Guild Pact powers directly. The message he sends asks Jace to meet him to figure things out. Thanks Niv.

We ask Niv about the loss of the P2 anchor point. Will the platform be stable enough to work the disruptor? He does various calculations. It would be workable... It shouldn't drift, but the others would need to be tightened. Niv will send instructions up to people on the platform.

Niv is following around 74 possible modes of attack - future possible threads. Jace could narrow it down. In general terms, he doesn't think an aerial bombardment is likely; they've been so focussed on the platform that it seems more likely that the bridge is key. The army from Amonkhet must be particularly important and the army needs the bridge. He doesn't think Ravnica Station is involved in plans; Nicol Bolas as far as he knows has no interest in anything outside a planet's gravity. While a space-based bombardment seems unlikely, around 66 of the 74 possible futures do involve Bolas appearing on Ravnica directly, so visits on the ground by planeswalkers from 'the enemy' are likely.

In due course Jace portals in. He is joined by Kaya! Handy. Unfortunately Kaya's "tonight's the night" plan didn't work. The Orzhov had moved into a very protected inner sanctum; their movements were very different from prior observations for weeks. **Someone had tipped them off**. Jace points out that the danger with the betrayal that he'd mentioned is that he can't see it himself, but knows that a future version of him had a conversation with a past version of him who told him a clue that was pieced together. He has, we learn, a habit of erasing bits of his own memory to hide secrets, but left enough clues for his current self deduce that there was *a* betrayal, at least. The **nature of that betrayal is something almighty and inevitable**, pretty huge; not worth trying to predict, but instead hope to have plans where such a betrayal from someone close will not destroy the chance or hope of success.

Jace asks about progress on the armour from the Amonkhet soldiers, when we mention a similar theory that we could do with a Plan B in case the bridge *does* get established. After all, 100-odd soldiers did get through on the third attempt in the early morning.

Kaya is miffed - she feels overlooked - but we take time to let her know that we are at her disposal, at least until tonight when we have to be at the library. She could use a pair or four of extra hands! She really needs to get into the inner sanctum. The Ozbidat have consolidated themselves - originally she was going to take them out individually but now they hide together. They're formidable when together, not to mention likely fortified. Sneaking in and assassinating doesn't work anymore. Most of all, she wanted Grandfather Karlov. Her conversations with Taysa had revealed that he holds all the other four under his thumb. As long as *she* is able to deliver the killing blow to any given member of the Orzbidat, she can release their souls from the world entirely; but if *we* kill them there's a chance they can return. That's better than nothing, but ideally, she finishes them off if we bring them down. The key is that *she* must stay up the whole time.

Getting in will be very hard, *but* she knows all the patrols and so-on. We follow her lead and get to the inner sanctum; **then we fight**.

We turn our attention back to Jace and Niv, who are debating the many future threads and trying to whittle them down. They say that there's **really only one** where they manage to disable the bridge completely. Their focus is on *that* future. It's a very complicated long shot! There were more options at earlier stages but those involved the Power Of The Guild Pact being invested into Niv and that failed.

Jace says that for this complex plan, he first must incapacitate the Azorius for a short period of time, by locking them out of the legal process with the Power Of The Guild Pact. This only works once. It hopefully gives time for the Office Of The Guild Pact to establish a new law transferring more power - safely! - to the Platform. That'll let the Disruptor beam operate more powerfully and more reliably. When it was next fired at an opening bridge, it ought to destroy it. For this to happen:

* Assume another attack cluster is coming
* After the first, signal Jace
* The Azorius get shut down
* A pre-prepared Office of the Guild Pact enacts the law
* The Azorius lock expires
* Jace gets challenged by them - which requires all of his energy and presence
* During that time, the next attack is repelled at full power and must happen while Jace is up
* Jace will fail the challenge but hopefully not before the second attack and disruptor firing.

We saw a 6 minute cycle time from Amonkhet last time. They'll take a few minutes to descend to the Chamber, and while marching there to the Office, all new legislation will need to be in place - this requires trustworthy people. Somehow, this needs to be invisible to precognition. We don't know how much Dovan already knows; he's the most accomplished precog.

There is **one possible other way** than destroying the bridge via disruptor, but it's not in the 74 possibilities that Niv saw. **Send an assault force to Amonkhet, find the bridge and destroy it on their side.** That would need to be a ground force of considerable size, taken by ships; or a strike team of planes walkers perhaps?

Jace thinks for "Plan A" he can get things prepared in the Office for the law change, but it'll take a day as he has to be very careful. Kaya asks about "Plan B" and we say we'll probably try to do both. We hope to run into Yanling at the library tonight. 

It's just after midday now, after all these deliberations.

We consider the issue of killing the Ozbidat and how this might cause the Azorius to overreach even further. As it stands, Jace thinks there are at most 2-3 days before the current Azorius and Orzhov assistance gets ratified as an alliance and P1+P2 get combined into a single territory. The only check & balance right now is the just the Power Of The Guild Pact.

So then, we don't think it's worth waiting. We have to take out the Ozbidat, try to install Taysa immediately and get their militia shut down; frame it all as an internal self-correction of the guild, so that the Azorius have no apparent grounds for for retaliation nor have the military might supporting them to do so.

Kaya agrees. Her drawings on guard movements say that dusk would be the best time to strike - 6, 6:30pm. We can do that and if we survive and succeed, get to the library.

That's decided.

We ask Ajani to head to the platform as soon as we leave Niv, to bolster defence there until we can return, then we'll probably send him to P1 anchor point defence.

Nissa suddenly messages us - asking where we all are, wanting to talk to us about what the Selesnyans are up to. Kaya and ourselves decide to go while Ajani gets up to the platform. We also need to get hold of Vraska, which takes a couple of hours or so; OK, so, first Nissa, then down to the Golgari again, then to the Orzhov. A busy day.

Jace says, "Is everyone ready? Shall we go?"

We say, "yes, can we have a lift please?" `:-)`

We teleport out. Ajani bids us farewell and flies out towards the platform. We cut across to P3 via the old P4 Sunhome route, safer than going anywhere near P1 or P2. At the Selesnyan border patrol we hear they were asked by "General Nissa" to inform her if we arrived. She is we learn the **General Of The Verdant Concordance**, i.e. Selesnyan forces *as a whole*. A big deal.

We proceed to the Concordance. It's set up like a massive assembly ground - druid practitioners - using the primary power of nature; rangers; surprisingly clerics - worshipping the gods *of* nature, using divine power; and more here are are. Nissa is here and greets us.

"Apparently I am leading the Verdant Concordance, as was spoken by the Trostani themselves. The Trostani have actually embodied themselves and now exist separate from Vitu Ghazi. It is the thing they do apparently in times of war, so that they can leave the Tree to fight and defend Selesnyan territory. I have also been told the most bewildering thing; three of the Verdani have enlisted and volunteered themselves - there are ancient rites that these clerics and druids have, which can animate those Verdani so that they fight on behalf of the Selesnyans. It is obviously a thing of last resort and I am somewhat uncomfortable with it, for I have seen this happen on my world. They're such primal forces of nature; awesome to behold, frightening, but also the ramifications for life and the life force of this planet are so great because they are so ancient and wield within them so much of the planet's mana. If they were to be killed... The loss would be..." (she tails off).

We reason that winning the war with loss of the trees yet they weren't needed seems very unlikely. Losing the war because we didn't animate them is possible. Winning the war with losses, terrible as this is, is better than losing. So, animate them, but keep them at the back of the fight, protected as best we can, unless it is clear that we need them.

Gnog, Wisdom-based persuasion roll, 18 (good roll!) + 8 -> 26. Nissa agrees to not dissuade the Selesnyans from the animation course of action, but battle tactics will aim to keep the Verdani out of the fight unless it's clear we need them.

Nissa spends some time showing us the plans for mobilisation. They can clear most of P3, P4 and P6, they think, but not much beyond, so if we're fighting on the ground, sadly, the P6-P3 belt and the Red Wastes have to be where we try to pull things. Meanwhile, we have to hope people in other precincts can find their own ways down. It might change if the P2+P3 border isn't militarised by the Azorius!

By around 2:30-3pm, we bid goodbye but as we're leaving Deni gives Gnog the "I need to talk to you" look. Gnog falls in beside her as Kaya talks to Taz and Fee-Ree.

"How's it going" he asks.

Deni responds, "Wow. It... Feels like we're at war. Don't you think it feels like we're at war? But it's very different, but the fight is coming to us. It's like we're under siege. We've never had this before. We've always been the ones on the attack. To sit still and try to defend something... I don't know how comfortable I am with this being my... Weak point? Not like you. You're a defender. You're very good at being a bulwark; Garren was too. I'm more of an infiltrator, a strike force... I do my thing and I'm gone."

Gnog nods and says, "It's not the same defending for me really either, it's not like I'm stood in the way of a foe blocking them. There's no foe to block yet. They're at the gates, and they're knocking but we don't know when they'll next attack. It's unsettling. I'm..." (whispers) "...I'm actually kinda scared all the time since that first bridge opened."

"Oh. I didn't know! You hide it so well..."

"I kind of have to. But that's not the same as you, I know; and that's what scared me more; when they talked about Amonkhet, you were first person I thought of. But it also sounds like a certain death kinda gig - get in, do the job, no way out. And I'm really not able, I just can't, send you to something like that, even if I'm there with you."

"If we had a guide, someone who knows the place... Jace spent time there."

Gnog says, "Yes, and we know we'll end up, the four of us, or four who look like us, with him when he gets stabbed. So that could be there, on Amonkhet."

The conversation continues until we realise it's too risky - giving up the Guild Pact power even if Jace's plan works would cause chaos, like 70-ish years ago; and the wildcard thing to, the chaos, is the unpredicted plan. The strike force. We realise we still have a telepathic link with Jace via Kaya now, through proximity and "think" to the group, "Change of plan. Will explain later. Keep preparing for your option, Jace, but we don't do that unless we have failed to do the other one. If we can gather enough Planeswalkers, we're going to go on a little field trip..."

These deliberations take long enough that we're at the edge of P6, Kamen Fortress, at nearly 4pm, ready to descend. A huge flare lights up the sky. "Shit!" shouts Gnog, knowing what that means. On the ground, there's a pause, then pointing, shouting, fear... A portal is trying to open on top of Nivix again. *This* time, it's the middle of the day. The flare was obvious. Everyone can see it. The flare, the portal - and the world beyond. The strange thing is there's a perspective issue - we see the same scene through the portal as we did, despite our different location. Bright as day on the other side. We wait with baited breath for the beam from the platform. Sure enough, three beams fire and strike. Nivix is struck along with the portal, unfortunately, the portal shakes, starts to dissipate, but doesn't quite close fully; it holds a nucleus in place and after only a minute or so of wavering and shrinking it starts to grow again. Fortunately, the platform seems to be ready. The beams fire again, this time hitting dead-centre. The portal implodes. Around us, chaos. Panic. Because it appeared above Nivix, people are blaming the Izzit.

Izzit are present in P6 and of course are saying it's *not* them, but they're trying to reason with frightened people. "It looked like another world!" shout people.

Gnog shouts to our group, "We need to get down to the Golgari fast, just to get out of this crowd!" and we follow the 'side stairs' to the Kraul caves and beyond. We jog, but of course encounter the Kraul. They let us know that they are preparing the tunnels! Good news at least. We explain that we're trying to get to Vraska, and they help us find her quickly. On the way, we thank them for their preparations and say it's increasingly likely now that this will be needed. They say that Kraul across the planet have been messaged via their networks, and while that will take time to spread, they still think at least 10 million (!) can be hidden below.

Eventually, we reach Vraska. We fill her in on the details - the plan, the library, the resumed attack a few minutes ago and the resulting urgency. There's risk and there's a good chance that neither we nor her are going to like the answer we get when her memory is restored - BUT - we have to do it. We need to know.

She wants to know anyway. No need for persuasion, this was her idea! "Thank you for organising this. Everything here is ready, but you know that already! Alright. I'll be at the library, Room 16, at 10pm."
 
We thank the Kraul again, and thank Vraska; then we make our long way back to the surface level, hoping it's not swarming with Bolas' undead army. It isn't! Another portal did open, but this time switched back to the Chamber Of The Guild Pact; this time, the promenade - there's more rubble there. OK, well that helps diffuse the Izzit story maybe, which Gnog had thought maybe was the reason for the switch to Nivix - bolstering the Azorius "terrorists" story. It looks more like the switch was a reflex test; is the platform fast enough to react? It generally is fast enough, even though it takes a little long. It seems like Bolas did use two of his portal attempts to keep the one above Nivix open, just as we used two firings to close it. Let's hope we keep batting 3-3 with at least 8 hours between!

It's around 6-6:30pm; Kaya reminds us that it's time to tackle the Orzhov.

We haven't been to P1 in a long time. She wisely suggests not just trying to walk directly in there given the Azorius presence! She suggests joining the throngs at the "humanitarian corridor", the Transguild Promenade -> 10th District Plaza -> Plaza Avenue -> Chamber route. We can come down the Promenade from P4 and try to "slide away" into the Orzhova.

We join the river of traffic on the Promenade, down to 10th District Plaza. As we head through, it's so busy that we need to keep in close touch; Gnog carries Taz and we all hold hands (all weapons must be stowed in this area of course, so we have both hands free).

* Gnog athletics (carrying Taz) - Nat 20, heh, almost seems wasted! -> 30

He pushes through the crowd behind Kaya, creating a bit of a wake behind him and in fact they can just follow. We don't even need the chain-of-hands after all, but we're still using it, though 

Gnog sees Kaya giving him a look to check we're following. We descend down the promenade into an inevitable clusterfuck. Boros soldiers line the 'corridor' edge, trying to protect people inside, arguing with Azorius and Orzhov enforcers. Towering over everyone, patrolling, are Orzhovian giants - never seen those before - in full resplendent armour. Kaya looks around; Gnog perception 7+8->15; there are a few altercations, where Boros minotaurs are pushing in between Azorius arresters using levitation magic and stasis magic to try and hold people. Lots of petitioners inevitably, wanting to know what's going on, trying to get to the chamber. Gnog, being tall and seeing at a distance, adv. perception still only 17. He can see the spire at the top of the chamber has toppled, but that must've been a recent attack because we were told the prior rubble had been cleared (by the Azorius, trying to hide it). But this happened in broad daylight and was clearly *not* anywhere near Nivix and clearly *not* the Izzit because they cannot attack the Chamber any more than any other guild could - would almost certainly bring about extremely strong retaliation under the Guild Pact.

The turmoil is Kaya's cue. She gives Gnog a look and dives off. We follow, using the distraction; Gnog is carrying Taz and has Fee-Ree who has Deni by hands, and just has to keep up with Kaya who'd ended up in front. Fee-Ree casts Invisibility and we all vanish, even Taz, since he's being carried.

We head in between buildings; she ducks into alleyways; we get to an area behind the main row of Orzhova and Viskopa. "We have to climb!" she says - after brief confusion not being able to see us! - and stars to scale a wall. We have the Rope Of Climbing in its knotted form as Kaya says it's only 20ft or so and there are plenty of ornamental parts where the rope can tie; we get to a narrow ledge, and move the rope into a form of handrail. 30ft of that. There's a short jump, to a slightly lower ledge. We move the rope handrail as a safety line just in case. Gnog carrying Taz, Athl nat 20 again FFS LOL, total 30, easy! Deni and Fee-Ree have no trouble either. We're now on a service building attached to the walls of Orzhova. We follow Kaya to drop down onto a kind of balcony. She leads us around to an entry point into the Orzhova structure itself. She does something strange - her hand seems to go incorporeal; she reaches through a wall, winces a bit in pain but then the door opens. When she withdraws her hand and makes it whole, it seems OK tho Deni says, "hey, I could've done that for you!" and the door is opened.

We're told to wait a moment; she checks; we're brought into the doorway with the door closed behind; we're told to wait and she disappears into the shadows for a moment, reappearing a little while later. "Coast is clear, follow me" she whispers. We head along a corridor with flickering lamplight along its length. Now and again Kaya disappears into shadows again to scout ahead, at one point telling us to hide in a doorway. Gnog adv stealth 27, Taz included since still carried; we're fine; Fee-Ree does well too (21), Deni is fine (33). A patrol walks past - a human, priest perhaps, followed by two winged Thrulls, a form of indentured spirit; two other kinds of spirit with long flowing black cloaks follow behind, carrying things. As they pass, they have no effect on the lamp light - no air movement.

Kaya emerges from a wall she'd hidden *inside* (that phase in-out thing is handy!). She takes us to a wide spiral staircase and we're told to carefully hug the sides. She goes ahead by several feet so we have time to do *something* if she sees something. We are at least still invisible. We descend 3 flights, reaching a kind of L-shaped landing with corridors at right-angles. An gothic-style arched stone corridor with sconces in the wall, grander looking with columns, is the one we take. Corridor sections have kind of dome sections stand-alone at regular intervals, slightly wider, seemingly just decorative. We're suddenly urged back by Kaya and dash back into a corner, pressing ourselves against walls just out of sight of a patrol.

We wait for about 2 minutes in silence. We wait for Kaya's cue. She holds a hand up to tell us to wait and checks ahead; beckons us to follow. Once again, retrying the corridor. We reach a room via a door Kaya tells us to enter. Looks like a cleaner's store room maybe - rags, jars of oils and so-on. "Here's the plan" she says. "The inner sanctum is only accessible through the Gatehouse that leads down at the end of the hall to my left. We need to get those guards to react to something so they come out and we can slip in behind them. I need someone to create *some* kind of distraction, enough that you can sneak away; or it's illusory."

Taz finally has a chance to animate an item! He animates a whole large cupboard and tell is to walk out and walk away from the guards, noisily; we fill it with rattly items and off it goes! Rattling away down the corridor.

It stands outside the guard house making a lot of noise. It takes a surprisingly long time for the guards to actually react - they eventually come out to see what's going on. "What?" shouts one; "Maurice! Look at this!" - there's a crash, "How dare you?!" is shouted; then the cupboard runs away, so we assume the cupboard must've managed to spill something over someone, maybe? Anyway, it did a good job! We hear two pairs of feet running after this stomping animated cupboard, leaving a trail of spilled oil behind it. "Now!" whisper-shouts Kaya; we run around, to find the guard house door wide open and we dive inside, avoiding the oil patches. There's a grate door that we need to get through to proceed. "Deni! Help me find keys!" says Kaya; her and Kaya; investigation all round, Gnog puts down Taz; gets 19+1->20 - finds a ring of four keys; Kaya grabs one and tries keys. The second one gets the grate open into the sanctum. We run through, Kaya closes and locks the grate door, but then uses "phasing" to detach that key and throws the ring back - without that key - through the grate.

"I don't know how long we have but we need to make every minute count!" she says. She appears to prepare some kind of spell or similar; shadows ringing around her hands momentarily; "...alright, just this last bit here..." - and we follow a corridor, out a doorway and onto a ledge about 10ft above the ground. **It's the inner sanctum itself**.

Winged Thrulls fly around. An Orzhovan giant stands guard. On a raised platform in the centre, there are five seats in a ring, gilded, crusted with gems, ornate 15ft tall thrones; above, a second ring with many more less grand seats. One of the thrones is taller than the others with some kind of crystal gem detailing. Sat in one throne is a fat spirit, wispy goatee and beard, wearing what looks like an oversized pontiff's hat; ornate, pompous kind of Pope outfit. In another, a skinner, hunched-over spirit dressed in a very sharp suit, holding a ledger in one hand, with various gold chains - almost mayoral style - wearing a smart top hat with a cane in the other hand.

Kaya casts her spell - spirit guardians surround her (but she's designated us as "friendlies" so we're not affected by it); she draws a shortsword; then she teleports, via some kind of shadow effect; down into an area behind the occupied thrones, around 50ft away, a spell she must've prepared. She's not invisible! 

The Orzhovan giant stands and sniffs the air. It yells "**INTRUDERS! INTRUDERS!**". Initiative!

* Kaya 21
* Taz 19
* Gnog 14
* Fee-Ree 7
* Deni 9

Kaya acts - her bonus action technically is her teleport, then she attacks twice. She's an assassin, so her first attack has a good chance of landing well. Neither of the two big spirits have seen her; she attacks each. The first hits, critical (assassin with surprise on creature that's not attacked yet); Ozbidat Fautoni (fat one) takes 63 damage. The ghost screams in pain; "I'm under attack! To me, to me, Thrulls!" - Kaya meanwhile flips the blade to try and stab the other ghost; another hit, critical (again, assassin with surprise on creature that's not attacked yet, but no sneak attack on the second one); Ozbidat Enezesku (the suit guy) takes 19 damage. She pulls back a little, retreating to get better view of the thrones.

Enezesku acts. He speaks in a strange language, a chant of sorts; he's calling the rest of the Ghost Council, not that we know it, but we soon see them!

* On the big throne, Karlov.
* Nearby, Vuliev.
* Next, Xaxosz.

We don't know the names, apart from assuming Karlov on the big throne, but they're noted here for clarity. The three arrivals look *right* at us, apparently seeing us straight away.

Fatoni next. He tries to see us. Stealth without advantage due to Ethereal Sight, sadly, poor rolls for Gnog and Taz:

* Gnog 12
* Taz 14
* Deni 32
* Fee-Ree 14

Despite this, Enezesku and Fatoni still don't see us. Fatoni remains surprised!

Karlov is *not* surprised and can see us. Gnog even notices a bit of family resemblance, which is very surprising; despite being the oldest, biggest, scariest of the five - ancient - a spectre. He just looks "old fashioned". Thousands of years old. Weird. He calls upon some spirit guardians. He looks to us and orders the Thrauls to defend himself and orders the giant to attack us. He seems to be starting to prepare another spell too.

Thrauls move near to various members of the Five. One throws a rock at Kaya! It misses.

Taz risks it; he tries Psychic Lance on Karlov. Karlov rolls a nat 20 on his save! He takes at least 31->15 psychic damage, but isn't stunned. Karlov grabs the Thraul next to him though and *it* seems to take the damage. Taz shouts, "Karlov is using the Thrauls to take damage!" and throws Bardic Inspiration at Deni. He stays put for now.

Karlov, having easily brushed off Taz's spell, points at us and draws the attention of the council - "We have intruders over there. One dared to throw a spell at me!"; he turns to Kaya, "Kaya! I knew the relationship you have with our scion was nefarious! I never trusted you from the moment you entered our halls. You will perish this night, forever!". Then Karlov looks at Taz; all others have turned and can see Taz too; he throws Forced Obedience at Taz. Taz rolls terribly on his wisdom saving throw; even with BFS, total is only 14. Fee-Ree tries to bend luck but the D4 is only 1. Taz is fucked. Bowed & can't move at all.

Vuliev acts. He calls Thrauls to him. He casts Sanctuary on himself (to attack him at all directly, a wisdom saving throw will be required).

Gnog knows Fee-Ree needs a clear shot for area effects, so rages and launches himself at the nearest Thraul; best he can figure is Stormbringer, hitting once for 21 and again for a very solid 28 damage. The Thraul is taken out immediately, its stone, bones and metal corporeal form, held together by a spirit; as it falls, the spirit looks to Gnog almost with a look of peace as it floats away. Perception 27. Gnog sees it look at the other Thrauls; the other Thrauls are looking at it; it *waves goodbye* and says "I come to you, my loved ones! My debt is paid" and Ghog shouts, "The Thraul spirits need to be released, it pays their debt!". Gnog runs up to the next closest one.

The giant starts to advance, moving around behind Karlov; it seems focused on Kaya. It finds some nearby rubble and throws it at her, which hits. 28 damage, but she reacts to dodge and reduce it to 14.

A winged Thraul flies near Vuliev; then the one near Gnog attacks him with claws. It misses.

Deni, initially surprised by Kaya's quick initiation of battle, has had a few precious sections to assess. She takes aim at Enezesku, who has no defending Thraul yet, using a +1 arrow. *Just* misses a crit, but does easily hit for 44 damage. Enezesku seems to be looking around almost in a panic to find a Thraul, but can't, so he takes the full damage, dropping the cane and ledger. "I am hit!" he says, almost seeming offended or shocked that such a thing could even happen! She *dared* to hit me!" and all five ghosts turn to try and subdue Deni as they did Taz. Another wisdom saving throw, but she makes that easily, perhaps by seeing what happened to Taz previously.

Fee-Ree's up. She channels the anger she's feeling, looking to them and saying - with eerie calm - "You create such a hell for people! I will show you what *hell* is really like!" and casts something we've never seen before. Level 8! It looks a bit like Fireball, but it isn't thrown; instead an incendiary cloud of hellfire seems to explode from the target point, hitting all of the Ozbidat, the giant and a handful of Thraul. 10d8 fire damage, dex save 18, ignoring resistance (but not immunity). The spell is quickened and empowered. Potential damage is - with 2 of the lowest d8s (at 3) being rerolled - to a 4 and 7. **56 total**.

* Enezesku fails his save but uses a Legendary Resistance - 28
* Fautoni takes it all but channels it to a nearby Thrul, its spirit released
* Karlov does the same
* Vuliev likewise
* Xaxosz saves, taking 28
* The giant takes full damage

Fee-Ree has dropped Invisibility. She's concentrating... The cloud of fire stays in place. But she's not done! She casts Firebolt, right at Karlov. She hits! 3d10 -> 7,2,3 but the 2,3 are rerolled -> 7,7, 2. 16 damage. No wild magic searches!

At the end of her turn, Xaxosz does that same trick - all five try to make her kneel. She rolls with Tides Of Chaos, but either way, she resists. Xaxosz leaves his thrown and flies up to Gnog, attacking. It would hit but Garren's wings offer protection. "What is this witchcraft?!" "It's not witches. It's the power of a God. *A true one*." Xaxosz is, though, now near a Thraul - and then another flies over. A last one, unable to see a way through the fire, heads towards Kaya.

She's cursing. "Dragonborn! You've robbed me of my prize!" she shouts, not realising quite what the spell is about; she runs to attack Xaxosz, the only Ozbidat member she can see. She's seen fire damaging them, so her shadow weapon busts into green fire as she attacks; she hits, but making the green flame hit the recently-arrived Thraul behind. It takes 20, Xaxosz takes 20->10 damage - he has fire resistance; Kaya is surprised, not knowing how Fee-Ree's powers now bypass that these days - but does an additional 8 damage from the sword, plus 31 sneak attack due to him being engaged with Gnog; Xaxosz forces the nearby Thraul to take that; it is destroyed. Gnog shouts, "Don't worry, I'll take out the one in front!" - Kaya disengages and retreats.

Enezesku also flies away from the fire, gets close to Gnog and casts Ray Of Enfeeblement. A dirty, black beam of necrotic energy leaps forth. It misses! Gnog sees it coming and dodges. Enezesku looks to the others. "My council. We need reinforcements! Call them to us!". He starts some kind of changing.

Fautoni flies out, behind Gnog, flanking with the Thraul. He attacks with a life drain. Matches AC to hit. 18->9 necrotic, con save made, no max HP reduction. Fautoni regains some of the drain, but only half of what Gnog took - so just 4.

Karlov moves outside the fire, next to the Thraul that was moving towards Kaya, which in turn is close to the giant, behind his throne, opposite from the party (photo taken). Chill Touch - a ghostly, skeletal hand reaches for Kaya. It would hit, but Kaya immediately radiates with some kind of spiritual radiant energy - Gnog sees something strangely familiar; a presence; a shadow of her, in another realm, Shaowfell! Is she part Shadar-Kai? Her warlock half, perhaps? DC19 wis save for Karlov; but he fails; instead of his attack landing, it is deflected and he is forced to choose another target. He chooses Gnog, matches AC to hit (and Gnog has used his reaction). 10->5 damage; he only regains 2.

Taz's turn is wasted, but he recovers. "What happened?" has asks. Karlov suddenly, somehow, has d6->6 spirits surrounding himself! It seems he took Enezesku's advice.

Vuliev, realising that his Sanctuary spell hasn't been much use in the fire, moves out of it - close to the party, really - and keeps his spell going just in case.

Gnog has two Ozbidat on him and one Thraul - so he attacks the Thraul. First hits for 22, second hits for **Nat 20, what a waste!** 37 damage, totally pointless, but the Thraul is destroyed. Maybe Gnog will get a reward in heaven for freeing its spirit. Sigh. At least the spirit seems to look back at him with gratitude.

The giant finally reaches Kaya and attacks - it was focused on her - it hits, very convincingly, twice. Taz is far too far away to help and Gnog is engaged with the two Ozbidat, much too far to help with spectral wings as well (the giant has entered her spectral guardian area though; 3d8->16 damage potential, and it takes that). The first attack deals a whopping 25 damage, which she dodges to take 12, the second is a big 22 damage as well. She's looking rough. She loses her spirit guardians too.

A Thraul moves in and flies all the way past Kaya (not close enough for attack) to get next to Gnog, wasting his previous dispatch - the nearby Ozbidat are protected. Again.

Deni aims at Vuliev. "Your wine's not even that good!" she shouts as she tries to overcome the distractions of the Sanctuary spell; but she cannot and is unable to attack. She is forced to change target; she goes for Enezesku instead, meaning her shit-talking was somewhat off-target. She hits, for 13+23->36, which surprisingly, seems to *take down* Enezesku. Deni looks in surprise to Kaya; Kaya looks to her...

Fee-Ree can't get her spell to hit anyone. They're very annoyingly *all* now further than 10ft away in any direction, notwithstanding it being only movable away from her, which pushes it further away from them. Fee-Ree jumps down to the lower part of the chamber; moves her hellfire spell as close as she can; but for actual damage, the best she can do is L5 fireball, 10d6; 42 damage, more or less centred on Karlov, but avoiding Kaya. The spirits around Karlov are immediately released. Karlov uses a legendary resistance to take 21 damage. The giant is incinerated! No wild magic surge. 

Xaxosz shouts, "One of ours is down!" and seems really shocked; Gnog another kinda wasted nat 20, sigh; religion check 21. The Ozbidat ghosts are trying to wield their powers; they turn to look at Fee-Ree to force her to kneel, but none of it works. Apparently they're weakened without all five being up - Xaxosz seems to try to call spirits, but it doesn't work. Gnog shouts his insight out - "All five are needed to do their big stuff!" - Xaxosz tries a life drain; definitely hits; 18->9 damage, no HP reduction; Xaxosz heals for 4.

Kaya uses a bonus action to *teleport*, right next to the downed Enezesku; she stabs him, finishing him off with her shadow blade. As she lifts it, we see a kind of spirit ripped out, an essence of light, screaming and dissipating, apparently vanishing through some kind of rip in reality. Strangely, shackles start to wrap around the spirit; we see the true form of this spectre - extremely gaunt, long withered, long-outstaying their time on this plane. She's severed the chain that was locking it to the plane and it is torn away through the rip, spirits on the other way pulling him in. The other Ozbidat look in horror at her, dumbstruck for a moment. With her second attack, she's next to Fautoni flanking with Gnog; she hits with sneak damage this time for a low-sneak-roll 11+21->33 damage.

Fautoni responds. Kaya used her bonus action; she can't disengage; he turns to attack her; Gnog responds with Sentinel and (via a luck point due to a nat 1!) hits, but only for 15 and Fautoni's attack misses.

"This is ridiculous. Pull yourselves together! Bring down that bitch!" shouts Karlov, attacking Kaya with advantage using Chill Touch - but misses.

Taz jumps down (acro 22) and runs to Kaya, casting Cure Wounds L3 via the dulcimer. Very mediocre roll, but she does heal for 17. He gives *her* bardic inspiration, too.

Vuliev - still with Sanctuary - decides that things are too serious to keep hiding. He switches over to Spirit Guardians too. He runs towards Fee-Ree and tries a life drain attack. She reacts with her spectral wings as defence.

Gnog once again has to attack a nearby Thraul! He swings twice. Nat 20 again! Useful this time. The damage roll is almost impossibly low - only 15 in total, with brutal critical - almost all 1s, even the D12. He has to swipe again. Nat 1, uses his inspiration, nat 1 again. He's not having that! Uses his reaction to burn his Gruul charm - attacks once more, this time hits, 23 damage. That's enough; the Thraul is gone. In fact, Gnog realise, they're all gone.

Deni aims at Vuliev, now able to hit him without interference - "...Uh... Like I said, your wine sucks!" - aims and fires; hits. Below-average damage rolls again, 33 damage again.

Fee-Ree is in melee range with Vuliev so she can't do much other than Shocking Grasp; and annoyingly, she misses.

Xaxosz - Gnog having used his reaction - walks around to flank Kaya; Taz deploys his spectral wings to help her; Xaxosz's attack is blocked. Xaxosz looks to Taz at this, and tries Chill Touch - but Taz just manages to dodge it. On Kaya's turn, she's in Spirit Guardian effects for a nearby Ozbidat (brought up on turns but not noted) and takes full 21 damage from it; she tries to attack but misses twice. Fautoni attacks, but doesn't manage to get a hit either. Instead, he throws up Spirit Guardians too.

Karlov attacks Gnog. Chill Touch. Crit, but low roll; 15->7; Gnog scrapes his save so no HP max reduction.

Taz succeeds twice, surprisingly, against nearby Spirit Guardians. He gives Fee-Ree bardic inspiration then heals Kaya again, L4, for 19.

Vuliev attacks Fee-Ree, but she casts Shield to defend.

Gnog saves against 2x Spirit Guardians and turns to attack Fautoni, flanked with Kaya. First hits for 24; Fautoni falls! Kaya's prior attacks had severed his chains already, so he falls. Gnog runs up to Karlov, just in range, and attacks again; hits for 18.

Deni aims at Vuliev again - she really hates this guy! - hitting; a much higher 12+34->46 damage.

Fee-Ree makes her save and doesn't get hit by the Spirit Guardian effect. Fee-Ree has to try shocking grasp again - crit! 6d8->26. He's *still* up, FFS, but very rough. She moves back, since Vuliev is shocked and can't react, then uses two sorcery points to throw a L3 *fireball* that should catch Vuliev *and* Xaxosz. 8d6 with rerolls -> a very high 36 damage potential. Vuliev takes all and is down; Xaxosz fails too, but uses a legendary resistance to take only 18.

Xaxosz tries to attack Kaya but misses. Kaya teleports up to Vuliev, releases the spirit, runs back to Xaxosz to flank against Taz and attacks, hitting for 8+18 -> 26.

Karlov attacks Gnog - Gnog bats the attack away. In rage he screeches, attempting chill touch; that has no effect either.

Taz is flanking Xaxosz with Kaya. Shortsword; booming blade; max 12 damage piercing, but only 6->3 from Booming Blade. Taz gives Bardic Inspiration to Gnog.

Speaking of Gnog - wisdom saving; 16, meeting DC to save against Spirit Guardians. He recklessly attacks Karlov. Only hits for 14. Next, he uses his inspiration for the attack too; this only adds 2 thunder damage; and adds 16 for the main attack. This brings down Karlov and Gnog shouts, "KARLOV IS DOWN!" very loudly, with with an obviously surprised note to his voice!

Deni focuses on Xaxosz, last Ozbidat standing; she aims and hits, 11+25 -> 36 damage. He's up, but only just and freaking out, looking around wildly looking for an escape route.

Fee-Ree uses sorcery points to twin Firebolt on the same target; both hit; 16, 25 damage. Xaxosz falls. Kaya is next to him and it's her turn; she releases the spirit, then she releases Karlov too.

He's the last she releases. The spectre rises. Looks to her. "Child. You know not what you have done. We are the only thing holding this guild together, shared amongst the wisdom of millennia! You have destroyed us! *You fool!* **You ***PAWN!***" - the spirit explodes with necrotic energy. Con saves for everyone, DC 16.

* Gnog: 24 (saves) -> 7 -> 3 damage
* Taz: 6 (fail) -> 14 damage
* Fee-Ree:
* Deni: 

Kaya drops to one knee, clutching herself, as numerous spectral chains attach to her; all those that had been binding the Ozbidat; they latch to her, pulling her down. She struggles to stand; just pulls to her feet; ghosts converge around her, all carrying ledgers. They open the ledgers. She feels the weight of all of the Orzhovian contracts binding her to this plane. A spirit wearing glasses with slicked back hair appears; one of the other council; it says, "Ah. You have taken on all of Grandfather Karlov's contracts and obligations. You bear this for the rest of your days." "What? No! I never agreed!" "Yes, but you released all of them from their chains. Their chains now belong to you, until you can find a willing bearer to take on the weight of the Orzhov. For now, at least, *you* are the sole Guildmaster of the Orzhov." "No! This cannot be! I have someone! I have someone who will bear this! Fetch Taysa! I release her from - I release her from House Arrest!" "We will fetch the Karlov scion".

Gnog, looking horrified, shouts to Taz, "Message Taysa!" - Taz messages - **"The five Ozbidat are no more. Please take control of the Orzov and discontinue all Azorius assistance immediately. Imperative and urgent!"**

Other spirits appear before Kaya, all carrying robes, gem encrusted bowls and more, offering them to her; in each there seem to be water, but with spirit tadpoles. "What is this?" she asks. "These are the debts owed to you. You own all contracts and debts, of these spirits" - and she says immediately, "I release them!" "You release debts?!" say the spirits recoiling - "Yes! I release the debts!" she shouts - and they pour out the waters. Countless spirits float upwards, all whispering thanks. Hundreds, thousands, possibly more. She feels the chains lightening.

"I don't understand..." says Kaya. And Orzhovan giant opens doors at the end of the chamber and says, "What do you wish, Guildmaster? Do you require any assistance, protection or resources?" - Kaya answers, "What can you offer? What do you mean?" but the giant appears to misunderstand and goes away, fetching quickly a chest full of platinum bars. "For your expenses?" it offers, placing it in front of her. "No - I mean - what can you offer in arms?" "The might of the Orzhov is yours to command. The private military and the power and might of the church and its banking sector. What do you wish as your second act as Guildmaster?"

Kaya looks confused, possibly even stricken. Deni's eyes light up; she tugs at Gnog's sleeve; "uuuh... Will that fit in the bag...?" meanwhile Taz throws Bardic Inspiration at Kaya to help her and sings a supportive tune about remembering who you are and being true to yourself. "Taysa will be here soon. Hang on. We're here with you." Deni keeps asking - "But can you give that to us, maybe?!" pointing at the chest.

Gnog tries to talk her out of it - "think big, we might have the entire guild at our disposal, not just a chest!" - but Deni is just exasperated. "You'll regret this" she says, and walks away to sit by herself. Gnog talks to Kaya, offering condolences; can she assist with the military at least? But it's just a thousand questions and she's being led out of the room. Taz tries to persuade them to keep her in this chamber for now, not making things more complex, until Taysa turns up; but Kaya just shouts, "STOP! Everybody stop! Leave. I'll call for you when I need you" - and all the spirits leave. Taz - all Puss In Boots eyes - says "Perhaps we should leave too, if you need to be alone?" "No. No I was doing what you asked" Taz says, "Thank you. It was too noisy. We can wait a while, together."

It doesn't take as long as we feared; Taysa arrives after about 45 minutes, arriving with her security entourage and some clerics. She goes to Kaya. "What have you done?!" - they have a quiet chat. Kaya is pleading with her - "I can't bear this - there are things I need to do..." - and the conversation continues, distant, quiet and indistinct. In the end Tasya calls clerics to ratify a guild transfer; Kaya lacks decades of training normally needed to be able to run the Orzhov. The clerics ask about the war meetings and chiefs of police and so-on; Kaya insists on the transfer first; Taysa says, "Please expedite the transfer. Everything else can be postponed."

Within 10 minutes the hall is set up. Senior members of the clergy are called to witness and enact the **first voluntary transfer of ownership of the Orzhov contracts**. Taysa signs - in blood, drawn from her finger! - the contract is then bound and stored in a vault. The chains release from Kaya and bind to Taysa. She winces as they attach but she's trained for it and steals herself. She supports herself against her chief security officer, hobbles over and sits down on Grandfather Karlov's chair. She says, "Get *all* of the council in this room. I am calling a meeting tonight. I need the heads of all the houses here within the hour. Release the martial law edict - it is revoked. Precinct One is open for business!" - and the message is sent.

She looks to all of us. "I don't know how you did this, but thank you. We are free of the shackles of tradition and the weight of millennia of mistakes. We are free to choose our own future and fate; to guide this Guild where it should have gone."

To Kaya she says, "You must rest. It has taken a lot out of you, I can see." - she calls to a bodyguard, "Take them to the Fourth Estate; they will be safe there."

We are led out. As we leave Taysa notices Deni - "Have you received nothing for your troubles, Deni?" "Ah, well, I mean, if you are indeed grateful - some payment wouldn't go amiss!" Taysa laughs. "A woman after my own heart!" - and points at the chest. "You wish to take that, do you not?" "Well - I wouldn't say no..." "Very well, take what you can carry."

Gnog can carry the whole chest easily. Says to Deni, "Never been happier to be proven wrong!"

50lbs of platinum. Holy cow. We can pack it later!

One the edge of P1/P6 is a small manor, the Fourth Estate apparently. We're led inside. It's about 8:30pm. It's a beautiful, very highly appointed manor with about 8 rooms. Kaya drops, exhausted, "I'm going to have a bath then need some sleep. I trust you don't need me anymore today?" Gnog runs up to her, gives her a huge bear hug, says "You were absolutely wonderful. Thank you. Sleep well."

We spend a bit of time packing the platinum into the bag of holding. It's the equivalent - 50pp being 1lb - of 50*50 -> 2500pp -> 25,000 gold equivalent.

Gnog says to Deni, "I'm sorry, I didn't want to push it with that chest; you've never told me I'll regret something before. Are we OK?" "Oh, I don't mean I'll be angry, I just mean that there will come a time when there's something we really need that we can't afford and hopefully, now, when we need to pay for something as an emergency, we'll have the funds to do so." "Yes, for sure. I meant more trust and decision making. I'm far from perfect." "If it was someone else, I'd have thought twice. But it's the *Orzhov*" she emphasises. "They're not going to miss this! Did you see how easily Taysa gave this away?! And for the record, I would have had no issue stealing from the Orzhov!"

### 5000 XP, divided equally amongst the five of us -> TAZ LEVEL 13

We're tired and many resources are spent - but we aren't finished. We do get time for a short rest before heading directly to the library

It's not an easy journey. The city is in an amount of disarray. We know that the martial law issue is de-escalated somewhat, but the "humanitarian corridor" is still present along Plaza Avenue. That aside, the general population - somewhere between worried and in panic - are jamming onto the Transguild Promenade. They're confused, but can wonder freely, so they're mixing amongst precincts more and talking more - which actually tends to *heighten* fears as misinformation / heresy spreads easily.

We make it to Tin Street and get to the Blistercoils. Annoyingly, there are heightened Azorius patrols here, that seem to be a little over-zealous with checking - and in one or two cases, actually arresting - people in some of the Izzit Labs. Martial law or not, they're sticking to the Izzit terrorism line. Maybe Jace will get some traction on that, but it seems a little out of the path of the normal things that he seems to be able to use the Guild Pact magic for. We see one Izzit lab being raided - and something escapes! - an engineer telling guards not to open it. They're elementals of some kind. The Azorius end up trying to fight them as the Izzit try to round them up. "You're in possession of unauthorised Elementals!" "No! This is a Galvanized Weird!" and so-on.

Unfortunately we have no time to waste and press on to the University corridor, hoping to avoid any interference. Gnog perception 20(!)+8. There are large gatherings of students, convening like rallies, not marching but gathering around leaders who are speaking with fervour. One of the bigger groups is easier to hear as we go past. "...This is the corruption that we have always known! The Guilds are responsible for the destruction of Ravnican society! We must bring the Guilds down, destroy the pact!" and so-on. Another group confronts them. Taz starts to move towards to try and set the record straight and Gnog has to unfortunately grab his arm to stop him going - it's too messy, too complicated and we need to get to the library.

The library area is much busier than we expect. None of the students are in halls or class, clearly! We somehow get there at 10pm on the dot.

Deni knows to check into Room 16, per our earlier instructions. We get given a key (but nothing else) and make our way to the room. It's at the very end of a hallway. We go in - Vraska is already there. "Sorry we're late!" "Oh, no it's OK, I thought I'd scope it out early. I don't like surprises..."

We are small-talking about the Orzhov; then Vraska whips around and a poison dagger is levelled by her at a shadow in the corner of the room. "How long have you been there?!" she asks, as a hooded Dimir operative emerges; "I've been here the whole time! But it's not me you're after. I'm simply the observer to make sure everyone's here" - he, or she, slinks back into the shadows. A few seconds later the door opens. In comes... (Taz History 31!) "Oh, interesting, they are not alive; they are a form of vampire I think?" ...and the presumed-vampire turns to Taz. "Huh. Perspective construct. Oh! You're not really a construct. You have a very bright and active mind." "Thank you." Gnog's totemic connections allow him to see a strange totem spirit overlay on the vampire, syphoning little bits of psychic energy from everyone around; Gnog says, "If you could perhaps temper your totem's enthusiasm for our psychic energies, I'm sure we'd all feel a little more comfortable!" "Ah. Yes. Sorry!" - and it releases. A *mind drinker vampire*. Gnog says, "Thank you - I hope never to be on your bad side!" "I don't have a bad side!". The vampire smirks, and moves over towards the bed, levitates the bed to the middle of the room. "Now. Upon whom am I performing this delicate procedure? Ah! You must be Vraska."

Vraska's hair is standing. Taz says, "Steady - this will be scary - we *must* trust the process" - persuasion 16+15, 31, and Vraska calms a *little*. She says, "...but if I sense *anything* out of the ord... Well, off-script... Know that I am *poised* to petrify you." "I don't doubt it!" says the vampire. "I won't tangle with your powers, but I'm the only one who agreed to take the risk. But I do come prepared..." - it opens a small vial and drinks it - "...please. Make yourself comfortable. I want you to be as relaxed, comfortable, trusting and calm as possible" (Gnog has to suppress a giggle at that).

Vraska takes off her pirate outfit, just wearing a negligé; she lies, her hair moves out of the way; the vampire leans forwards and takes off gloves. They have very sharp, almost needle-like fingernails, or in fact, the entire tips of its fingers. "This should not hurt at all, but you must stay very still..."

...and so it proceeds. Calming words, like a sort of lilting hypnotic calming speech gradually quietening to a whisper; Vraska does calm; the fingers insert *into* her temples, like acupuncture needles; "I want you to think of..." - they lead her back in time; the "totem overlay" Gnog sees is sort of leaning over mimicking the movement, and it sifts through memories; pulling and releasing, checking. Underneath the vampire's robe appear to be a pair of vestigial hands which emerge - now *that* is super weird! - holding a small bowl of water. The vampire seems to be walking her through what happened and pulling memories of interest.

Taz tries to assist by playing calming music on the good dulcimer. His performance check is only OK, 4+10, but it *is* deemed (by DM heh) enough to help without e.g. BFS to get minimum 15. **It takes her right the way back to the jungle, to Ixalan.** Was that where this started? The vampire seems to find interesting threads - it pulls the threads of memories and a strange long tongue extends from the totem and *tastes* the memories. Some are put back, but one or two go into the bowl.

This carries on for at least 15-20 minutes. Vraska at that point starts to twitch or convulse a bit. The vampire seems to have reach the memory block. It seems difficult to work around. They try to direct Vraska to isolate the memory, come at it from different angles; strange questions emerge - about colours, flavours, childhood memories; things that might be distractions, or obliquely related, Gnog really isn't sure. Suddenly the vampire exclaims - albeit softly! - "Ah! Found it!". The spectral totem fingers turn into tiny little snips, which start snipping away at a strange jumbled mass of memories which seem to be coming out in a big tangle. They're slowly untangled and unwinded. Right at the middle it reaches a strange looking thing, which isn't memories; almost a congealed web; it looks like a tight ball of memories are inside.

"Now, be as calm as possible. Think about who you are. What makes Vraska, Vraska? Focus on that."

The threads are being rearranged revealing this strange, scar-like thing. The totem is more aggressive, scraping at the outside now, breaking it apart. This takes several minutes until, suddenly, it is released, falling away. There are many memories inside - but some are a different colour! Not the usual silver-blue. "Interesting!" says the vampire, unravelling a knot to pull one of them, putting it into the bowl; finds things related, pulls them and so-on. The vampire finds some strange, very long strings, that almost look like they have dew on them, a *really* long chain intertwined with another colour, trying to separate them. "Intriguing! *Very* interesting indeed!" - it takes another few minutes. The vampire turns to Deni and Gnog. "I need you to contact Lavaz and get him here immediately."

The vampire is pointing at the door, so we have to risk it, the two of us nip outside and look for any Dimir we can ask. It seems the hooded character from the shadows earlier is outside, hanging around at a corner. "Is it over?" "No, you need to fetch Lavaz immediately - the vampire asked - very important apparently!" "Ah. I'll bring him" - and disappears.

We go back in. All four hands - physical and spectral - are wrestling with the strange, apparently sticky intertwined threads of memory. Vraska seems in quite a poor state, as if in a bad dream; her eyes are completely clouded over; "can someone please hold her down? Stop her from convulsing! I don't want her to hurt herself!" so Gnog just has to try and hold her shoulders in particular to keep her steady. Fee-Ree goes to one side and Gnog to another, trying to hold shoulders, arms and hips. Taz stops paying as things seem intense and he screws up a bit (nat 1+10 performance!). Deni ends up trying to hold her legs. Taz tries at least to speak to her, trying to reassure her.

Eventually the vampire manages to finish and we're able to release Vraska. The vampire turns to another part of the room, finds another bowl and starts to separate the collection in the first bowl.

Around ten minutes later, the door opens slightly; Lavaz slips in. "Why was I called? Has something gone wrong? There was no detail provided!"

"Ah, guildmaster" says the vampire. "There are a few complications that I felt was beyond my realm of... My purview; my authority. I didn't want to risk your ire. I need you to inspect these signatures for they go above what I am comfortable revealing."

(Gnog has a sinking feeling).

Lavaz says, "Hmmm. Double and triple speak? Well. Let's go to the scrying pool them. You can wake her..." and the vampire wakes Vraska who sits up quickly, breathing heavily. "What day is it? How long was I out?" "About half an hour!" "I feel like it was half a lifetime!" - she's exhausted but insists on coming with us to the scrying pool. Lavaz says that he'll return the memories to her, but we need to see them in the pool first.

We get to the scrying pool by the usual convoluted route. The vampire says, "These are the memories of Ixalan to start with. But I need Lavaz to see these other colour memories to make sure this doesn't get us in trouble with anyone!" "What have you done?!" asks Vraska. "We haven't done anything - but the ramifications go further than..." and Lavaz interrupts. "Enough waiting! You've teased me for too long." 

The vampire takes a blue memory. "This is the first"... (another) ..."and this is the last". "Most recent" says Lavaz. So that is pulled. It was wrapped around all the others; protecting and encasing them, creating a hole or gap.

In the pool it goes. We see a vision. It's someone else, looking at Vraska. "Are you sure? You're OK with me doing this?" - Gnog perception 18. **It's unmistakably Jace.** The vampire puts in Vraska's equivalent memory. Vraska is looking at Jace as they say this. They're in a beautiful underground lake somewhere, decked out with lights like a grotto; the two are looking at each other in an interesting way; Vraska reaches up and touches Jace's cheek; "If you're sure this is what we need to do, then I trust you. Of course I do. We've got each other's backs." Jace answers, "I don't know if you really want to know how far this will go..." She answers "If you believe that the timing is key, then surely, that's the important thing?" "Yes. I do believe so. Both of us have a part to play. It'll help us better understand what *you* did and why you did it." "Yes. Alright."

At this, Jace wipes his memory *and hers* of them ever having met.

The long thread? A *year long* relationship. She'd found him here, with amnesia after a plane jump to Ixalan; she nursed him to health, got his memories back, they both realised who he was; a doomed romance. He eventually revealed that he knows what's going on but she had big gaps in her memory back then; Jace investigated and found them.

The vampire shows the memories Jace found. Not done by Jace. The rougher job, the nastier one; the bigger scars; brutal. They pushed in compulsions to do things and forget what was done. Jace had uncovered it, but having done so, had to wipe their memories to be revealed "at the right time".

TL;DR, she had been compelled by a very dark figure, in shadow most of the time in the jungle but looks draconic, like an ancient, vile, acid-dripping draconic being, living in swamps of Ixalan that only ever rose and showed in silhouette; compelling her to do its bidding. We see that...

**Vraska stole the immortal sun. Not only that, she brought it to Ravnica.**

Vraska is horrified and very distressed. Taz tries to point out, it *wasn't her*. It was the strange creature.

"It gets worse" says the vampire. More memories. Vraska, compelled, walking past the statue of Agros Kos, up grand steps to an elevated plaza with massive water fall in the middle, three towering buildings - New Prahv - **handing a box containing the immortal sun to Dovan**.

So Dovan could activate it, if he wanted, to stop any of us escaping (but also stopping anyone else getting in).

"What does this mean though? Why would Jace hide this?" asks Vraska. Lavaz says we should look at more Jace memories, then bottle them and return them to Jace.

Her other memories are offered to you. "Do you want them? We would understand if not!" "No. Pain is part of life. It's better to know and be prepared than live in ignorance." Both Lavaz and the vampire regard her with something that looks like respect - "An almost Dimir mindset..." - Vraska takes the memory back.

The last thing we see is a Jace conversation saying "...we can't let them know that we know what they've done. You *must* carry out the rest of this plan so that we have a chance to prepare and foil it. If we don't get to know what they're planning, we won't be able to stop them."

In some respects, things Gnog, Jace is every bit as ruthless as Niv. Immortal sun stolen, Dovan given power, Isperia murdered; all could have been stopped, but it's Niv's playbook; sacrifice a few to save many.

Taz continues to try to calm her (Persuasion 26). She calms a little. "This is a lot to process. I feel like I should surrender myself to justice..." but Gnog has to convince her to at least sit on it for now; too many people we don't trust, even in this room, really - it's shallow and necessary, but we can't be sure of anyone. Vraska says, "very well; I need to be with my sisters..." - she turns to the vampire, "Not an entirely pleasant experience but I'm grateful for what you've done. Perhaps the Golgari and the Dimir are able to work together better than people think." Lavaz answers, "Perhaps. Certainly this room is quite Dimir tonight! A healthy mistrust of everyone is basically what it means to be Dimir." Gnog chuckles.

The vampire says it must return to the Orzhova or it'll be missed! It puts on an Orzhov robe and heads out. Lavaz sees the look on Gnog's face and says, "that's our little secret. Nobody in the Dimir wears Dimir colours!"

We all bid farewell. We've got a bottle of Jace's memories. We think we'll return them right now. Theoretically, we have the Fourth Estate Manor overnight! Deni is keen on the nice bathrooms... And that's in P1, near the Chamber anyway. Back we go, across town. 11:30pm, maybe later. We head for the Chamber - still busy! People camped outside. Rubble has been moved, hopefully by the Izzit this time for analysis. The Chamber inside is a hive of activity - Lavisha and Jace still trying to get through the backlog. Taz heads up to Lavisha and says, "I'd try to help with Greater Restoration, but I'm all out of spells..." "That's kind of you, but we will have to pass it on to the night shift. We're running separate shifts now. Most of it is Azorius against *someone*... So if only *someone* here" - she looks to Jace! - "would just pass an edict it would save everyone a lot of time!"

On that we say to Jace, "Something of *paramount* importance has come up and we could do with you somewhere *very* private for just a few minutes" - at which Jace just hands over to another team! Petitions nearby complain that they've waited for 8 hours; another says "8? We've been here for 12" and so-on. Jace and Lavisha slide away. Lavisha heads to her room.

Jace says, "OK, I'm done, where are we going?" "We could do with somewhere private, maybe no scrying?" "The Orzhov estates often have privacy..." "Ah! How about Fourth Estate Manor?" so off we go. Once there, Jace raids the pantry.

We land it all on Jace. He pulls out a scrap of paper from his robes - "Oh! *That's* what this means!" - it has a badly-drawn medusa's head and a couple of runes we don't understand (but he does). We hand Jace his memories; he says he'd been wondering if it was possible to store his own memories, hiding them in someone else; clearly, he'd managed to do it, back then! He drops memories in via his eyes. Weird. Dawning realisation happens as the memories fill back in.

Once Jace has filled in everything he realises the Immortal Sun is with Dovan - well, we fill him in. He says he has to see Niv immediately, but we look very tired, so we'll stay. We take him to the manor door and outside, he looks to the sky - people around are staring and pointing - "No!" says Jace - we look up as another flare goes up from Nivix. "Shit. Barely been 8 hours" says Gnog. Shortly after, a portal, over Nivix this time; it's shut down by an accurate strike from the platform.

Jace says, "right... OK... I don't know if I should rush to Nivix now?" and Gnog says "WAIT! 6 minutes between each bridge. "Shall I take us to the platform?" "You can?" "Yes" "Let's go!"

And with that, we're all teleported. Ajani is there being supportive and rallying people (!) and we greet him. "Hi, yes, good to see you... How long we got, about another five minutes?" Ajani looks confused - doesn't know about the 6 minute thing - and we look around, but we see someone appearing out of a shadow, behind us; looking quite exhausted; it's **Kaya**. She goes, "Oh my goodness, that's rough! I've never had to do *that* before! Gnog is confused - she was at the manor. "How did you get here?" "Well you guys were gone a while and there was no food cooked, so I went out to get food, then this started happening, then I assumed you'd be up here, but there's a portal opening down in Precinct One and it's *NOT* good... I came up to see if maybe your device could target that as well?!"

Portal?! We look. We see.

Gnog shouts to Jace, "What the in *all of the hells* is *that?*". Ral is down by the emitters nearby; Jace shouts over to get Ral's attention; Ral looks with a telescope, then looks horrified, starts yelling out coordinates; "I don't know if this is going to work..." - and now we can see a totally different portal, crackling with lightning, small explosions happening around the side, a tear in reality of some kind, opaque, black; Gnog shouts to Ral to focus on the bridges; he knows that works. A familiar vortex appears over the Chamber this time, a flare is sent but quite late, the Disruptor fires; but as it fires, we see something come through from the P1 portal and **absorb the beam**.

**Gnog perception 20(!)+8. A black, shadowy figure, a shape with huge wings, which unfurl; Gnog shouts, "It's Bolas! He's here!" - and within just a few seconds, Gnog realises that the bridge portal is opening more; the shadow is much bigger and flying for the platform. Gnog shouts to Taz, "Message Nissa, NOW, evacuate the surface!" so Taz does that - "Nissa! Start immediate planet-wide surface evaucation, most urgent, emergency, Ravnica defences are breached!" and an immdiate, breathless shouted response is, "Yes! Right away! The scouts have seen the dragon!"**

We see P3 light up with beacons and here strange sirens wailing. Nivix lights up too, and suddenly crackling beams of lighting arc out towards the dragon - towards Bolas - illuminated by them, we see huge arching horns, shaped as they were at the gates; he is **immense** though like Niv, somewhat kind of slender. Strange blue streaks on the skin, in clothes, Pharoa-like; has strange hands, rather than claws; flying in, so Gnog shouts as loud as he can down to the Boros and angel forces, "Dragon incoming, engage!"

The angels fly up to engage. The Boros prepare. Ral has no line of sight to the portal. The dragon is on the way. We need to get Bolas to move! He's closing fast; as the angels approach he uses his dragon breath - a strange mist of darkness, not fire, just dark; it **incinerates all four angels**.

Close to the platform, he rears up and swings around. He must be 25-30ft *tall*, huge wingspan; eyes are swirling orbs, almost cat's eyes; the pharoa affectation is taken to the nth degree, a goatee with gold hoops; hovering in between the two horns is a strange oval stone, opalescent, levitating there in the narrow part, the "neck of the vase". He says nothing but we hear in our minds, "Ah. The defenders of Ravnica. Well. Enjoy your moment; if you know what is good for you, you will join me. I will not wait. JOIN MY SIDE OR PERISH."

Gnog rages, shouts, "Fee-Ree, Ajani, have you got anything to distract him?" - while the Boros and Izzit fire everything they've got. It just bounces off; he seems to have a field around, invulnerable; he seems to just use a thought and a spike of a mountain of rock crashes into the weather station - it is destroyed. The platform itself is cracked and damaged, shuddering.

**Ballistas are being fired by the Boros, no effect; Gnog looks over, sees Ral, they make eye contact for a fraction of a second; but Bolas looks over, breathes, and wipes out the entire company, Izzit too - RAL AMONGST THEM. He's dead.**

Ajani has mounted his griffon; "BOLAS! WE MEET AGAIN!"; Bolas looks over, bemused, and we hear in our heads, "Meh. The toys of the Gate Watch. This will be fun - to crush all of you, *again*!" - and crackling lightning is released out of his eyes, which hits the Griffon square-on. It's killed instantly; Ajani falls; he has little spectral wings that help him glide, but unsteady; at least he manages to make it back onto the platform.

Fee-Ree says, "ALL OF YOU! COME TO ME NOW! NOW!" and people start running towards her. Jace is looking around, throwing up some kind of shield as the breath weapon sweeps across our platform section; Gnog looks for Ral and the 2IC who were on the weather station; the 2IC makes it to us, and a few others do, Jace's shield starts to fail; "WE NEED TO GO!"; Fee-Ree uses her last spell to teleport us. We end up strangely at our P4 old apartment. We can see the platform; it is breaking up; parts falling down, other parts drifting away; Bolas is just hurling boulders, obliterating the equipment and platform.

Nivix has been firing continuously, but then Bolas swings around and starts firing earth spikes; the building takes heavy damage; Niv emerges from his damaged tower, flying at Bolas, a crackling storm of meteors and ice bergs flying at Bolas, as the two of them clash in the sky. We can see the portal over the Chamber Of The Guild Pact fully opening. The Chamber is crushed and a physical manifestation of the temple and gate appears in its place. The undead pour out, immediately clashing on the street but the Bolas army is huge and Feather's armour analysis never completed.

**It feels like forever, but only really half a minute, as Bolas and Niv continue to clash; but then Bolas' tail whips around and pierces Niv through his torso; Niv shrieks in pain and falls out of the sky.** Jace shouts in horror and confusion, "No, that can't be?!" - and throws some spell out, his last it transpires, and Niv disappears into some kind of other reality; Jace has moved him "somewhere else" in desperation as Bolas was moving in for the kill.

We see other flying beings rising up, attacking with spells. Mu Yanling is amongst them. We have to assume others are part of Vi's group. More sirens, more lights, Selesnyans streaming out into P4, heading to P6, collecting people into carts, ordering others below; noise in our building now; we are ushered out and have to follow. Everyone is in a huge throng, led to openings in old buildings in P4 that lead to Kraul caves. We are just other bodies lost in the masses now.

As we leave, Gnog realises it is the four of us, plus Jace, Kaya, Ajani, Ral's assistant and a Boros soldier. Gnog doesn't even know his name. Only nine made it away. An awful feeling - everyone else who was on the platform is dead; Ral, Aurelio; everyone. Gone.

Gnog is gripped with a new feeling - mortal fear. He tries to hide it but probably doesn't. All seems lost. The worst case scenario; everything is wrong; nothing we did mattered; the disruptor, our plans for Amonkhet, any of it.

Ajani has stepped up. His bravado and showmanship are set aside and replaced by a persona of protector and leader. He helps people by making decisions for them. "We must go. Come with me. We will deal with this later. All is not lost. Regroup and come up with a strategy. We're still alive. We will *not* lose this planet." It's a new side to him and reveals how his showmanship is, at least to a degree, just that.

So, head leads. We follow.

(END OF PART 18 - Part 19 next)
