# Gnog: Part 1.1
## PROLOGUE: The Man Of Red Crystal

"Well... That could've gone better".

Standing seven and a half feet tall, Gnog was a Goliath -- albeit one of rather average size and stature, with a habit of talking to himself. Like others of his tribe, his grey-white skin was adorned with black tattoo-like markings present from birth; genetic indications of his lineage and history, passed down from generation to generation. At 300 pounds he was huge by human standards, but hailed from a culture of giants favouring strength and battle prowess above all else. Average wasn't great. A sardonic wit and unusually keen insight had never really found him any favour amongst his peers.

Gnog's name was suspiciously similar to that of his childhood hero, Grog Strongjaw, although Gnog always maintained that it was a coincidence. This could well be true -- he spent his first few years insisting it was pronounced "guh-no", because it was supposed to have a silent "G". A nice lady he met in a small village somewhere in the East one day was kind (and brave) enough to tell him that it was the _other_ "G" and, then, "nog".

Nobody is sure why Gnog's parents didn't sort this out for him a lot sooner.

As for Grog Strongjaw, he was said to have been twice Gnog's weight, a good foot taller and unmatched in battle in his early years, but he was undone by an unusual sense of fairness and justice in the heat of an enraged moment of madness to which all Goliaths are susceptible. He'd been left for dead by his tribe -- his own _father_ -- and all of a sudden, the young Gnog's enthusiastically drawn cave etchings of Grog's purported exploits didn't seem such a bright idea.

Deciding that attack was the best form of defence, Gnog attacked the Southward trail down from his mountain home and, quickly enough to avoid starvation in the unfamiliar lands below the snow line, found himself marching with a human army. A new tribe, where this average Goliath was better appreciated. And so it was that time went by; perhaps months, perhaps years; campaign followed campaign, following orders, taking part in glorious battles but with a niggling sense of not really knowing why he was doing it or what, really, was going on at all.

This is how Gnog came to be present at a small village on the outskirts of the city of Am, where a skirmish got out of hand. Some of the more long-serving soldiers, perhaps emboldened by their years in combat, took things further than their orders indicated. When it got to the point of looking at the village women in an manner entirely unbecomming - in Gnog's eyes - of a solider, he stepped in without thinking much about it and, before he'd even had time to say anything, found himself on the wrong end of his fellow soliders' swords.

With whoever it was he'd rushed to defend in tow, Gnog made an escape through a series of huts to the village outskirts...

## STELLARIN: 2nd campaign segment

* Janvair understands enough about the amulet
* Garren is going to freeze & soul be trapped between planes
* Stellarin may be able to help
* Veiled Wood - 3 days away
* Frickley town stop en-route, some distrust of our strange looking party
* Finally reach the wood. Fey wilds become strangely organised, then there's a clearing with the crooked tower.
* Meet Stellarin & Elf keepers Tidan, Vielesha and Paylyc (with whistle to call the latter)
* Elves say Stellarin is evil; trying to "order" the forest, destroy it; we have to rescue Edward, the sentient bush, in exchange for saying we'll get things he needs (both for him and to help us)
* His tower is strange. There's more to him than just evil intent. It's not quite that, something else happening. We don't get to the bottom of it. Seems alone. It is sad.
* Anyway, we need his list of stuff.
* Heading to troll cave, camp at a river. Harpy battle.
* Gnog gets drunk with a satyr, but is rescued by his friends.
* Overnight, meet Cedric the sentient bush, while Gnog's on watch. He tells Gnog all about the woods. A new friend.
* Meet old salesman Durren, likes Cedric. They chat together. Warns about troll having some affliction.
* Troll cave: Strange fungus/mould everywhere, but we note it doesn't grow in sunlight
* Battle 2 mushroom monsters, 1 rust monster (we lose some arrows before figuring that out) and the troll itself, avoiding mould hazard.
* Learn about fire & monsters that would otherwise self-repair.
* On way back we have 2nd thoughts. Stellarin wants even more stuff.
* Elect to go to elves for more help. They are relucant but tell us to talk to Fee Ree.
* We follow the path of lights to the sinkhole
* Bogarts; only show up around lonely people
* Fee Ree's story - and the dagger of which Stellarin spoke - Bent Knee. Too dangerous for anyone.
* We meet pixies. Tinklelolly. They like reflective things. We wanted their mirror for Stellarin and they'll swap it for a latern as they can stand around the panels of glass! We borrow mirror as a plan B. BUT - we have to drop a stink bug bomb in at Stellarin's.
* Nymph Seraphena. What does Gnog want? Garren will change. Probably won't remember anything.
* Gnog must choose.
* Seraphena uses the blade and amulet, destroying both. Garren trippy. Memory scrambled. Remebers Gnog, but his history differs. Events are scrambled.
* His friend is saved, though.
* Wrapping up loose ends: Cedric comes to meet Fee Ree. Veil's too thin at her house, it wasn't her fault. She's not ready to leave but appreciates Cedric's company. As we leave her, Cedric sits contented on a window ledge, branches outstretched for breakfast in the morning sun.
* Drop the stink bomb at Stellarin's. Feels bad, but it distracts him from his attempts to tame the forest. Estimate 100 days. We leave them to it.

## THE GIANT: 3rd campaign segment

* On the road home, before even getting as far as Frickley, get into a fight with 4 goblins attacking a family on the road.
* Three are killed. The third is pleading, saying that they just wanted food; giants are chasing them out of the hills, there's nothing to eat.
* Gnog's still raging and kills the last goblin (but deeply regrets it and spends considerable time relfecting and worrying about that in the days that follow; not all things assumed evil are actually evil, and not all evil things are beyond redemption).
* Rescues the family - Randur & Nathra Brighthearth (+ 3 children), who are grateful but the grisly scene with the last goblin was not great for them.
* They are farmers, fleeing Scoulton, a village to the North, which had been terrorised by hill giant Yagor Bonecrusher, kidnapping people, taking all the food and ultimately chasing everyone out.
* We continue to Frickley. The family's horses are killed but Gnog is able to pull the cart. We arrive very late.
* Frickley is already in crisis. Shortly after arrival we realise there is a town meeting about it, and attend, squeezing into the back of a crowded hall.
* We hear that the hill giant is upon them now, too. It has taken food and even some people away - and demanded more, "or else", promising to return in 3 days (and we're at the end of the first of those already).
* Tastra Fleetsong, 1/2 elf leader of Frickley's hunters, speaks of the near-legend of giant slayer Jahia, who left when young and went into the northern mountains where a frost giant was slain.
* After much debate it is agreed that while many will leave, the hunters and anyone else who wants to will prepare to fight. We will help by finding Jahia and together lay a trap to assault and defeat the giant when it returns.
* Old hunter Shoult wishes to be a guide, taking us on a path along Weeping Rock Trail, over a bridge and up into the hills. A young boy called Bale believes this isn't safe or fast enough, and knows of a shortcut via the river.
* We convince Shoult that old or not, he's needed for defence in town. We can look after Bale who is, after all, only our guide and not our guard.
* After a dicey moment on stepping stones over a swollen river, we are surprised and distracted to find a ~1m tall big pyramid of ice, all surrounded by thorny bushes, with apparently everything of a magic nature.
* What looks like a gem seems to be buried within. Deni can't resist and is agile enough to evade the bushes but the moment she touches the pyramid it shatters, revealing 2 ice mephits that been trapped within.
* We defeat them and learn to leave well enough alone that which we do not understand!
* A short distance further along the path, we meet druid Baband, who it transpires was responsible for trapping the mephits (and it's another story of the same nature - creatures are appearing in unexpected places, apparently displaced from the mountains, all moving to lower ground and displacing others in turn).
* Baband is apologetic that we'd accidentally been caught out by the mephit trap, we in turn apologise with messing it up in the first place! In turn, Baband warns us about wepping rocks - a harpy has taken up residence.
* At weeping rock, we have to fight and defeat the harpy. It is in a clifftop cave, and tries to call people to climb the cliff, only to fall to their deaths. While Garren has to hold onto young Bale, who was almost immediately entranced, Gnog has to hang onto Deni too, who spends a lot of time stabbing Gnog's legs trying to get away and climb to the harpy.
* Gnog has to end up holding both Bale and Deni, while Garren uses a perilous track to get onto the attack and while it is an awkward battle due to our lack of ranged attack ability, we succeed (75 gold pieces).
* Finally, we reach a cottage and meet Jahia.
* Jahia does not enjoy her reputation as a giant slayer, saying that others in her group had done most of the damage and much of even that was luck; she struck the final blow, but is no giant slayer. She's not interested in coming back to the town and hates the attention which is based, she feels, on a falsehood. She's a lot older now and has no wish to die at the hands of an angry hill giant, either!
* It takes some 4 hours. We have tea, we talk about how most battles feel like luck and how people always need a hero. We agree that she shouldn't get into battle, but she'll be a figurehead around which the town can rally and gain confidence. In the end, she agrees to return to town the next day and advise as best she can. One more moment of pretending to be a hero.
* Next day... The archers are mounted on rooftops. A huge pit has been dug, with treetrunks sharpened to crude stakes. Bale is on distant watch, and suddenly he comes running down the hill, shouting... It's on!
* The battle is fierce. The archers help with distraction, and the giant does fall and gets some injury in the pit, but it's not trapped there. A swing of its club almost takes out Gnog, but old Shoult is there and takes the blow instead. Jahia joins the fray, and is almost taken down; some mid-battle healing is needed; in the end, we just barely make it, as a township, defeating the dragon and narrowly avoiding deaths by last minute healing (and in mechanics terms - some death saving throws for Shoult).
* Town of Fricklee is grateful. Jahia's reputation is certainly now deserved, but she hands a Dwarven amulet - that says "Giant Slayer" in Dwarfish - to Gnog. One family hands us 5 oddly shaped pink pearls, despite our protests that we don't need gifts, but asks that they never be separated as they are a family heirloom.
* We return back home, to Duskhollow.

## RETURN: Campaign epilogue

* We learn from the druids that Stellarin's tower originally came from Luskan. There is much more to that tale, but we aren't able to do much about it presently.
* We also learn that Lousia and Bertrand left town in the middle of the night, after a visit by some mysterious stranger in cloak and hood.
* The road to Duskhollow is busy! Lots and lots of caravans. We aren't sure why.

* The next day, we move from the druid circle to town and note that the stables, inn and tavern full. At 1:45pm there still is only standing room at the tavern bar.
* We visit Adwyn at the temple, asking about Louisa and what happened. He advises us to go to her magistrate's house and speak to the caretaker Lenil. Adwyn warns us about recent thefts. The temple's chalice was taken. If it were to be sold, the closest places would most likely be Mirabar (north road) or Longsaddle (south road).
* We visit the magistrate house caretaker, Lenil. We get told the same story that the druids have; Lousia and Bertrand we seen leaving in the dead of night with a mysterious stranger in a hooded cloak. All the valuables are gone, an estimated 20,000 gold (!) total, basically all that the town has in that form of wealth. We hazard a guess that the temple chalice as taken as part of the same heist - at least, it looks like theft, anyway.
* One vital extra piece of information though - it looked very like they were heading over town towards the south road, rather than going north. Longsaddle, then; perhaps further.
* While thinking about what to do, we try to prepare better for whatever lies ahead. At Saladan's, Deni upgrades to studded leather armour and buys a hooded lantern. Gnog gets a lantern too, along with a shield (just in case) and heavy crossbow with bolts. He picks up a battleaxe to use with the shield. Garren always carries his shield and can't use much for range other than a hand crossbow, so picks one up, again with bolts, selling his light crossbow in exchange. We get some oil, rations and a local area map. We're able to sell some gems too, as part of the transaction.
* Gnog's curious about the various caravans. Since he has the giant slayer amulet, he chooses a group of dwarves to approach. It's a bit frosty at first but they warm to each other and end up spending time (and drinking), though there's little concrete useful information to be had. The caravans are joining to head south, to Waterdeep. Perhaps we might join them, to chase Louisa, albeit several days behind.
* After a long afternoon of the above, we head back tot he tavern for food.
* Very busy again. We meet a few groups:
    * A standoffish character at the bar in purple robes. We hear little from her, other than she is a worshiper of dragons, whatever that really means. She isn't drawn on much else, finishes her drink and leaves.
    * At a nearby table is a lively, interesting group that are apparently from Luskan in the far north. They've arrived in town from the South and are headed back North now, carrying important documents.
    * In very well presented (posh!) armour are some people who we learn are knights from Cormir. They are headed far, far north, beyond the spine, but need an escort after Mirabar. Maybe we're interested?
    * There's a table with four people quietly chatting. We introduce ourselves and say hello, asking what they're up to. The leader is Charlin - his group are travelling entertainers, "Charlin's Chaps" (well, chaps Charlin and Vaskan, along wit husband and wife Renwith and Druanna - Druanna says she's happy being part of the Chaps, it's just their group name).
    * They're more friendly but also seem a bit down on their luck. We buy them some more drinks & chat more. They're headed south on odd jobs, trying to make some money; need to get some beer down to Longsaddle quickly. It'll go off in four days, and normally it'd take that long only if you had a very fast run down the road, pushing hard each day. They're eventually headed all the way to Waterdeep and leave tomorrow first thing. They're staying at the stables on the edge of town.

# Campaign One: Part Two

## TYRANNY: 4th campaign segment
### Lennithon's attack at Greenwald

In the morning, we want to head south. We go to the stables and find Charlin's group packing up. We offer ourselves as an escort. They offer a modest fee, which isn't really why we're doing it but we agree, and as part of that, defer to them as the leaders of the caravan; we'll do as ordered.

It's a busy road, but we make OK progress; we do have to push on to exhaustion though. That night, even with watches, we sleep heavily. Gnog has a strange dream, which in retrospect, turns out to have been foreshadowing. A strange volcano in a barren land, circled by dragons; a strange, elaborate city in the desert; the frozen north. It doesn't make much sense.

In the morning, we continue. Around half way is Greenwald, which is to be our overnight stop. When we get near, we hear distant commotion; it's dark now, and we see flickering flames and smoke; people come running past on the road, heading away. We get closer, but eventually pull the cart over under the trees alongside the road - a *blue dragon* is attacking the town! Way above our pay grade; Gnog suggests heading away or finding safety in the trees, but one of the Chaps has family in town.

Gnog's party tells the Chaps to stay hidden and we venture in. Chaos, of course; but we find kobalds and drakes ransacking things, with humans here and there. We battle one small party and defeat it, worried always about the dragon, but it seems to have flown up to very high altitude and is just circling now. We go back and report to the Chaps. The horses are led down to a small river and the cart hidden as best it can be. The Chaps take refuge as we get more information about the family members, and head back in on a rescue mission.

We head back in. (See map) - mill is left/right near our left-hand main road entrance point, but down over the other side of the river. Keep just beyond a crossroads and bridge, exposed approach. More battles; we make for the keep; get inside.

* Human governor Tarbaw Knighthill
* Dwarf castallan Escobert
* We're told about the sudden unprovoked attack; they're ransaking, stealing everything and killing people in the way. Mostly seem interested in stealing though. Many are hidden in keep. There's a way out down a low tunnel that comes out in the field hear the river that could be used for escape.
* They ask if we can help with mill - people are trapped there, and it is ablaze. Urgent rescue.
*  In the opposite direction, their 3 priests are believed to be defending people who've taken refuge in the temple. This is also urgent.

We have to pick one, and the on-fire mill seems the mostpressing. The keep will try and get some soliders that way to help. We head back out, using the low tunnel to exit, and keeping between trees and river as best we can. We fail to stealth over the bridge and fight more. At the mill, we quicky determine it's a trap; there are kobolds etc. at the front building fires to try and lure people in. Sneaking around the back, we discover that there's a loft in the mill that has bad guys waiting. There *are* prisoners, who are the bait. We set up an ambush and manage to defeat the loft crew. We get people out, who run ahead and manage just in time to warn the arriving soldiers of the stronger-than-expected forces at the front of the mill. Those are dispatched. We act in constant fear of the dragon, but it remains at altitude.

We next head to the temple. Numerous enemy forces at the gates, and we cannot think of a way to distract them. Purple robed wizard (human ish size, male or female unsure) seems in charge. Robes look similar to those of the strange dragon worshipers we met in Duskhollow a couple of nights ago. Coincidence?

The purple guy appears to do some kind of spell that attracks the dragon's attention. It dives at him, as if angry, and breathes lightning but it doesn't look like a full attack, perhaps more a warning? The mage casts a shield, seems shaken but is not hurt, and fires something back; the dragon moves away.

We can see that the mage, then, is very powerful; a head-on attack is unlikely to succeed. We debate a plan of action, not being able to come up with a good distraction plan. Even finding a barrel of gunpowder on the street nearby and burning it doesn't work - there's already burning and explosion. In the end, we manage to sneak in the back through a gap in the koblad guard patrols. The priests give us a chance; they open the main doors open. The three priests there call down lightning and, due to the strain already from a defensive shield, this is too much for one, who falls. We grab some potions we're told are in a chest up some stairs, and try healing, but to no avail. We do manage to eventually rescue many of the people via the exit given this new distraction at the front, but only two priests ultimately survive. Everyone left makes it to the keep, which is packed full of people now.

The dragon dives for *us*. We tell Escobert to expedite evaluation down the tunnel, even though there's risk of a panic and people being hurt in the crush down there. We run to the ramparts, told about an old ballista on a tower. It's rusty and we have little time. We manage to get just one shot off, but it's wild and misses; the dragon breathes lightning and blasts a huge chunk out of the keep wall. Parts fall away, the ballista falling, but we jump to safety. Gnog tries to shout at the dragon, but it just argues back that he's not worth wasting its time. Seems insulted that we even tried!

Surprisingly and to the relief of all, it flies off - apparently it thinks it's no longer needed. The evacuation urgency subsides with some still heading off and others staying within the refuge of the keep. On a tip from the governor, we head out for one more battle - now rather exausted and low on just about everything, but a short rest in between at least - to try and capture one of their apparent group leaders. We're successful. He's a human called Torvan. We persuade him to provide information for leniency.

### The cult and their encampment

Torvan tells us of the dragon worshipers; specifically, they worship the god Tiamat, queen of chromatic dragons. This attack is coordinated by the leader Frulam, the purple robes mage. They are looting the town because they intend to bring Tiamat back to this plane, in corporeal form, and they must offer a giant hoard to her when they do this. Thus, looting - on a grand scale. Not just this town. Many. They also apparently have three chromatic *dragon eggs* at their camp, only a few hours away; this is where many of the raids are coordinated and stolen items have been taken.

We resolve to try and find the camp, but for now we must sleep, nervous watches in guard rotations being held at all times.

In the morning it's basically a siege standoff. This Frulam person offers a challenge - defeat their champion and they'll leave, else they'll take the keep and kill everyone within. Their assembled forces, that perhaps gathered more forces overnight, stand outside the gates and are large in number. To further make the point, they have hostages including the Captain Of The Guard's sister. They will be freed. The opponent is a blue half-dragon, Cyanwrath Langdegrosa, who asserts that this agreement *will* be followed.

Gnog aggrees to fight.

Gnog thinks Langdegrosa will be honourable; something about his manner and the brief conversation before they fight (lawful evil). The battle is difficult and Gnog's very nearly taken down, but in a surprise lucky blow near the end, actually kills Langdegrosa. There is a cheering from the keep. The cultists are shocked - some even flee - others seem uncertain, but then, hostages are released. However, Frulam is enraged and just before departing, at the last moment, throws a spear which appears to kill the governor's sister just as she was reaching the keep. The culists all flee.

Garren sees this from the ramparts and manages to make a desperate dash through the throngs of people, *just* arriving in time to save the grieving Captain's sister. She'll take a while to fully heal but lives.

In discussions thereafter, we're told that this town has heard a lot about the raider activity and had mostly been told about them coming from the south west or west, but this group had departed to the south east, in the direction of the hills on the way to Longsaddle. It's unusual and we make an educated guess that they've given away their camp location (perhaps they intend to abandon it now, or believe it so heavily defended as to be impenetrable).

We are asked to try and find out all we can, to aid in defence of other towns as well as this:

* Camp location?
* Number of raiders?
* Who leads?
* There's talk of the "Dragon Lady" - the purple robed Frulam, or someone else?
* What's the motivation for this? (Well, we think we know, but the capture'd Torvan's story about raising Tiamat seems far fetched and could just be a cover for more understandable common-or-garden greed).
* Where next?
* Can we recover any valuables?

We short-rest in the temple, planning. We're approached by Nissim Monks. One tells us of a half-elf master Leosin, who had been trying to infiltrate the cult to find out much of the above. He is feared killed or captured. It transpires that the investigation into this behaviour started almost a full year ago, but few other people took it seriously; they peristed nonetheless.

Charlin's group, meanwhile, has regathered. The family members of some of their party that had kept them here were OK, though their property had been burned; Charlie resolves to try and continue his journey South to deliver his beer, hoping it might be OK if only a day late or so, and get some money to perhaps help them out. They're thankful that we were with them and recognise that we won't be able to come with them further - they think they'll be fine for the next short stretch; Charlin, revealing himself to be a man of almost excessive integrity, even offers to pay us any remaining fee we would have got had we completed the journey (and of course, we refuse). We part as friends, shaken and unsure of what lies ahead. We hope that they'll be OK.

After that, it's time to tackle the cult.

* We follow the trail to the camp
* There are occasional returning raider scout parties or patrols - more humans, kobalds, drakes - which we avoid
* We do stumble across a camp, where some cultists are being cruel to kobolds. We decide to attack! We defeat the cultists and capture one; the kobalds flee.
* Fortunately a similar-to-before bargain for information works again (good rolls).

Information obtained:

* ~180 in the camp
* There is a 'rear guard' outer perimeter hidden either side of a pinch point between two rises/small hills
* It is a staging ground, with watchtowers and patrols
* About 1h 30m walk from current location (follow tracks)
* The "Dragon Lady" is in charge, operating out of the "main tent"
* Doesn't know where they're going next
* Motivation:
    * Take all valuables for the great hoard
    * Honour the dragon queen
    * Stock larder for the hatching of the dragon eggs
* Eggs are in caverns at furthest corner from entrance, accessed from bottom of a cliff
* Prisoners are in the south section of the camp
* Kobald barracks provide guard on both sides at the entrance
* But people come and go all the time, mercenaries...

We recover a few items that were being carried by the patrol; pewter candlesticks, golden carvings; fits in Deni's haversack.

We eventually reach the pinch point between two hills which have guards positioned on them; we manage to stealth around it due to the above warning.

We decide to feign ourselves as part of the mercenary groups. After all, we've got past their outer permeter guard.

Approaching the camp we see it is sunk down into a cliff-rimmed basin surrounded by a plateau. The floor slopes gradually down from the entrance area at grass level, to below. Watch towers are stationed at half way ledges and near the top. Plateau has long grass that might provide cover, with boulders and brush ~4-6ft high on approach that may also provide cover.

We note about 30 tents and huts for kobalds at the entrance. There is a strange five-finger greeting/salute; "Praise Tiamat". There is a feeling of jubilation; happy but tired raiders.

* We learn that the blue dragon was called Lennithon
* Surprisingly, the 'muggles' we overhear don't know how or why it turned up and take it as a sign that the cult is "blessed" by dragons
* We are famous it seems - our party's interference at the Greenwald raid, especially the defeat of Langdegrosa, has caused trouble. Gnog has to keep out of sight after that! We use scrub and bushes particularly heavy around the base of the Southward cliff for cover; there are even some small caves we can use as a base, since the majority of foot traffic is all centred in the main entrance ways and walkways between tented areas
* The "Dragon Lady" we note is called Rezmir ("the wyrm speaker") and we eventually see her from a distance near the main tent; appears to be some kind of half black dragon and is accompanied by a bald man in red cloak with tattoos on his head, who looks very mage-like
  - We overhear conversation about how they will "...reclaim our goddess' wealth"
  - This is a continent-wide campaign
  - They mention the "rise of Tiamat"
  - The "plans are in motion" and they will "have all five masks soon"
  - They will "call her forth", cauldron, fiery pits, that kinda vibe
  - There will be a "return to rule"

Over the course of the next while, we sneak around, using a small cave near brush and scrub for a staging ground, and do discover the tents with the prisoners in. We hear that "the monk's" (Leosin's) cover was blown and he has been captured for questioning. We manage to find and free about 8 others who we don't know. Then we find a tent with two people and special guard; we manage to distract and sneak in, finding two people. The first we surmise is Leosin. The second, from a distance, seems to be a brass-scaled dragonborn lying mostly face down... We gently try to rouse this individual and as it awakes and faces us **we are astonished to see our friend Fee-Ree** is somehow here!

Through cover of darkness, a less-than-attentive war camp in a state of celebration and initially going to use a Rope Of Climbing but worried about guard towers and, in the end, straight-up stealth hugging the South escarpment's base, we manage to sneak everyone out. We note amongst the celebrations (and, remembering that the hardest-to-hide area is near the entrance garded by kobolds, but they're badly treated and have ended up mostly gathering around their northern-side huts to celebrate as best they can without general abuse!) that the camp is showing signs of being packed up and we deduce that they have probably completed what they want to do here and will be leaving soon. Some lips loosened probably by alcohol loudly mention travel to some unnamed castle to the South. Anyway, we get out quickly.

* Inevitably, we encounter the rear guard and this time, we battle them - we're not going to try and sneak them out - and it's quite sketchy as one makes a run for it (presumably to alert the camp) and almost gets away but we do manage to take them down.
* We finally get back to Greenwald keep. Safe!

Next day there is much shopping(!) and then discussions about what will happen next amongst our party, town officials and those we rescued.

* Fee Ree had decided to "get out more" and ventured out of her hollow, but quickly learned of cult attacks in the region and ended up being caught in one nearby. Resmir seemed to think there was more to it - perhaps because she's Dragonborn and aligned good (brass / metallic) - so kept her around for questioning, not much fun, but anyway that was that. We almost feel guilty at having encouraged her to see more of the world but she's fine with it; fate, doing good, and now she's with some old (yet new) friends.
* Leosin is going to **Nesmay** to see an old friend - shows us a crescent moon with harp symbol and confesses that this is for a **sort-of-secret org called the "Harpers"**. His friend is a member - **Onthar Frume,** a Paladin of Torm.
* We learn that the red cape wizard seen with Rezmir is a **Red Wizard of Thay from across the Sea of Fallen Stars, far to the East**. Very powerful and dangerous.
* Leosin deduced that the cultists have 3 dragon eggs in their caves, along with stolen goods, at the far end of their encampment. We are told that it could be very bad if those eggs were allowed to hatch & bolster evil forces rather than following a more natural course of development. We are encouraged to capture them, though not instructed to do so.
* Accordingly, with so much at stake, we agree to return to the camp.

**Fee-Ree is keen to join us**. Everyone is very happy about that! **Our party is now four**.

### Finding the eggs

* Back to the cultist camp; a surprisingly easy journey, no sign of patrols or replacement rear guard
* The camp is mostly empty, with just a few stragglers, though the watch towers etc are all there
* There are still some mercenaries occasionally turning up with loot so that keeps people distracted
* We manage to infiltrate the main cave at night. Some flame control from from Fee Ree helps with torches mounted either side to give some darkness cover masquerading as wind blowing the flames around.
* Just inside, we dispatch two guards.
* A tunnel runs in a short way before some steps down to a strange cavern with weird fungus growths. Gnog heads down the steps without taking care, and the bottom one turns out to be a trap that makes him fall into the room. Set upon by 4 fungus monsters; we do prevail but take fair damage in the process.
* Using a 'keep left' rule Gnog then confidently leads down a narrow tunnel and walks straight through the doorway into a kobold barracks room. Yikes! Awkward battle as it's hard to get past him blocking the way, but he can't move out due to all the kobolds.
* We do *that* only to then end up in a room with seven cultists, who we manage to defeat; we're getting more and more moral difficulties with this because some are pretty young and they really are more of the "brainwashed" than "evil" variety but we've never yet managed, despite trying often now, to disuade them from their attacks. Another room with four cultists guarding a chamber that turns out to have none other than Lady Mondath - that is - **Frulam** in it.
* She does stuff like Spirit Guardians and we're taken very low after all the battling, but manage to defeat Frulam. It's a good thing Fee Ree is present. Wild Magic helps a lot, with no unexpected flare ups - Fee Ree is nervous about using it always, asking us to move away or telling us to be prepared just in case.
* We have no choice but to take a short rest here (hit die, Garren's hands-on, potions etc.)
* This surprisingly seems to have been Frulam's bed chambers. We surmise that she was trusted with guarding the eggs and given a fair bit of treasure in return. We find notes about what things were to be shipped off and what was being retained in varions tables, much of which doesn't make much sense. We gather everything we can, prioritising the paperwork. We also find a set of Frulam's purple robes and take those just in case we ever need to make some kind of ham-fisted attempt at impersonating a cultist...
* After a short rest, a bit more hands-on healing and a potion, we're in good shape and move on.
* We get to a cave which is warm & damp. There's a brief battle with a couple of guards and as we're taking stock, Deni moves to an adjacent chamber and shouts for help as a couple of guard drakes are there. We dispatch them without difficulty.
* The chamber is split level. Very warm and humid. We are on the upper level, with a lower section containing none other than the 3 large eggs!
* There is a creature on the ceiling - all tentacles, menacing voice and danger. It opines that we must be here for the eggs. We agree, though don't indicate that we're cult-or-not either way. It says it's hungry. In a flash of insight, we push the drake bodies down over the lip of the ledge to the lower level. Tentacles reach down and scoop up the bodies - delicious apparently! - the creater says it knows we're not with the cult, but doesn't care. It wants its cave back. It felt the vibrations of distant battles, heard us nearby fighting more; it wants the eggs gone, so its binding to protect them is finished. It's handed them onto someone else who seems to have valid claim, albeit by force.
* We don't wait for it to change its mind. The eggs are 3ft tall, weigh about 150ft each; two blue, one black; it tells us to keep them warm, and they might hatch in a week (!) - it's at the limit of Gnog's abilities to use arrangements of rope & strap the eggs around him, one front two back/sides, and just about carry them out.
* We follow around to a large, adjoined table down a short - mercifully wide, given Gnog's encumberance - chamber that looks almost like it might be an area of worship. A dramatic giant tapestry depicts the 5-headed Tiamat rising from a volcano. A large chest is present, which Deni manages to open, evading a trap. There is loot inside; we hazard a guess that this was Frulam's share - and astonishingly, we find, sitting in full view in apparently pride of place atop a side table - the chalice taken from Duskhollow's chapel! We take everthing we can carry.

We make it back to the keep unscathed, stealhing well around the South cliff again; the kobolds near the entrance, having been apparently badly treated this whole time, seem inattentive and frustrated. We arrive back at the keep in the early hours of the morning and given the importance of the eggs, wake the very tired and reluctant people in charge who agree to temporarily locate the eggs in a dungeon cell but keep watch & keep them warm with a fire (we aren't sure if warmth accelerates or slows the hatching, and don't want to take a chance either way). We lay out all the treasure we found, and much of it turns out to be from Greenwald - I guess Frulam found it easiest to skim off whatever portion she was allowed, once the final raid in the area had been completed and she knew how much she could take. The most recent acquisitions would be amongst the most easily accessed. There are other things too, some of which we hold onto and some of which we pass on, since nobody knows the ownership but we don't need heaps of cash and Greenwald needs a lot of repairing.

Via Leosin's consort, we learn that we would be best off heading to Nesmay with the eggs; Leosin has gone there, after all, and he may know what to do with them. And so, laden with the rather ridiculous cargo of 3 giant dragon eggs amongst our other belongings, we acquire horses and head out. Travel is uneventful on the dog-leg East across country towards Nesmay. It's also very quiet, on a road which even though it is not (we are told) usually busy, it wouldn't normally be empty either. It takes another 4 days to get to a river crossing, during which we pass only a couple of other people, one of who is flustered and worried about a "great imbalance", talking of dark days ahead and urging us to go back West, then follow the long road South to Waterdeep, hoping for safety in the city.

### Nesmay and Gnog's Axe

The main river between us and Nesmay is crossed via barge (8gp all in). We arrive at around 4pm, and cross - the horses are unimpressed by the affair, but we have sufficient animal handling skills to get them over. We find a stable and try to find Leosin.

* We know about the Harpers and "crescent moon with harp" symbol.
* We are told of the "A Pair Of Black Antlers" inn & tavern.
* We go there. Keeper called Volane, helper called Jubray. We're sent upstairs. We are able to perceive arcane symbols above a couple of doors. One for the harpers, and one not - it's a circle with a closed fist inside, holding a sword *blade*.
* Garren recognises this; it's something to do with the god Torm.
* We knock and gain access to the harper room. We find Leosin's friend Onthar Frume there. He explains that he's the reason for the second symbol; he is with a group called The Order Of the Gauntlet.
* Frume says the eggs should be destroyed.
* Leosin things they should be used for bargaining and thinks they should be taken to Waterdeep.
* We hope that there's a way to reunite them with dragons; are they intrinsically evil? Or can they be rehabilitated somehow?

A council is convening at Waterdeep but this takes time. We should bring the eggs there, perhaps, for a decision. We elect to wait a while at Nesmay. There are some things to find out either way:

* What, who or where Naerytar is - Leosin dispatches a rider to seek information
* Decipher the 'spreadsheet' of numbers found with Frulam - Onthar takes them to the temple bookkeepers

That evening, the party go for a walk to explore Nesmay. We see a smithy operating late, the light spilling out into the dark street. Inside are dwarves **Braenor and Dwendalyn**. They are impressed by Gnog's greataxe, but have something better - **they show him a Greataxe + 1** of their own make and enchanted at great cost. It's very impressive but Gnog is torn, as he's become so attached to his old weapon. In the end, he leaves his Greataxe with them; they say they'll clean it up and work on it, perhaps enchanting it too. Gnog vows to return one day to swap back. In the mean time, he pays for his new weapon.

The next day, we learn that the 'spreadsheet' has been decoded somewhat. It talks about wagons and the weights they carry, combined with a map; accounts for many ransackings; the map needs more work, but it's clear that **a hoard of treasure is being amassed**.

We need to get the eggs to Waterdeep and travel is arranged via a boat to Yartar, then by road across to Triboar, then follow the Long Road southwards. We'll need a cart or caravan and a way to disguise the payload, so that we're not trying to load dragon eggs on or off a barge in full view of everyone!

We are loaned a cart that'll fit on the barge. We get 3 crates fo the 3 eggs and put them towards the back. We fill in lots of straw around and come up with the idea of it being an ale/wine trading outfit, so clustered around the three disguised eggs, we buy:

* A 4th crate that we fill with 2 cascks of elven wine, each with 9 bottles (Silverymoon) (4gp ea)
* A 5th crate with 2 mini casks of Dwarven ale (10 gp ea)
* We also get a full size cask of Dwarven ale (20 gp)
* 2 Triboar mead barrels (33 gp ea)
* 1 Triboar ale cask (21 gp)
* 2 crates of miscellaneous books, mostly cheap, from a local bookstore - Fee-Ree knows which are worth or not worth much, but many people wouldn't, so it just looks like a side-hustle for anyone examining the crates (price not noted)
* 2 supplemental crates of feed and 1 of mixed rations are included, since it's a long journey (price not noted)

**SIDE NOTE START**

We later add during the journey:

* 2 cases of Westbridge amber ale (5gp ea)
* 1 case of wine, 9 bottles (5gp)
* 2 cases of Red Larch perry, 12 bottles each ("West Larch Perry") (4gp ea) from the farm direct
* ...and drink our way through some of the stock as we become the caravan's booze wagon - but I'm getting ahead of myself here...

**SIDE NOTE END**

### Boat to Yartar, road to Triboar

Gnog speaks to the horses and while they're not happy about being on a barge, they agree and we get them, the cart, ourselves and the boatmen on board a barge. The trip is nerve-wracking as we don't know what to expect given all the ransackings, unknown reach of this dragon cult, and the very sensitive/valuable/dangeorus nature of the cargo. Our fears prove fortunately unfounded this time as the journey is uneventful and we arrive at Yartar after a reasonably swift journey.

We don't hang around to examine the town; instead we get off the barge, get the draft horses hooked up and ride out immediately to Triboar.

### Triboar

We buy a beaten up caravan and Fee-Ree sets to work with spells to clean it up and fix it. We stock it up from the cart. We learn of a forming group of people staged at Triboar that will form up into a caravan; we intend to join this; perhaps Nesbit Farms, which sound like a friendly bunch, who we're told are in the main gathering just south of the city wall, 2nd row from the back (very precise!). 

The group comes up with a name:

* **"The Golaith Drinks" corporation**

...and we magically get this painted onto our carriage, looking new, but not brand new. We're a young trading company on our first big caravan trip to Waterdeep, looking to expand our horizons - but this isn't our first ever trade, as that'd be _possibly_ suspicious in itself given a relatively expensive set of things on board the caravan which would be out of reach of most first-time startups without investors.

We head out to the south group and chat with the farm people, but it's a busy area and we have to move a distance away to find place to camp. In the morning, we are greeted by some elves; it's a pleasant conversation and a chance for Gnog to learn more about their approaches, as we find surprising amounts of trust in one another. Out of the things they are trading, Gnog is shown a particularly fine **white wood flute, which he purchases as a gift for Eliastra** back in Duskhollow.

More people around. In amongst are apparent caravan support runners that are called "Teamsters". We learn that Waterdeep has some kind of ward that prevents dragons entering, but they _think_ Dragonborns are fine! We were worried about Fee-Ree.

Amongst other encounters, we bump into young couple Eric & Jemma, who have eloped, looking for excitement and experience on the road. They're paying for passage on one of the wagon groups.

Sniffing around for information about people in the caravan, we learn, through the teamsters, of **Losvius Longnose** who we should meet in the town square at "Knight's Call" and ask about halflings. Meanwhile, one of the protectors of the caravan called Leda, gives us a token (**CHECK BACK ON IMPORTANCE**) with "#1" on one side and two trout depicted on the other.

We spot what we think are the cultists. Four wagons, which later split up amongst the caravan. Deni's stealthy investigations reveal they're mostly empty. Each has either two mules or one horse pulling. Two people are attending each during loading - a teamster and a guard. The few things in each are in crates, so we don't know the contents yet. Later, we see a rather strange looking hooded-cloak figure that seems to be a rider to go with the guard in one of the carts.

We later do meet Losvius; a strange character, not trustworthy and yet doesn't seem entirely bad. We can't really figure him out. He says that there are two halflings around that are usually to be found at a particular bakery, looking for work, very good at sneaking about unseen; we should seek them out. We try, but can't find them.

That evening, we find dwarves. Gnog's axe comes in handy to break the ice here. There are 7:

* Eldkin, daughter of Agetul, the group leader.
* Lai, son of Anguston, who is sure that scented cooking oil will be the next big thing in Waterdeep
* Kai, younger son of Anguston who is more into food and clothings ales
* Tagit Skesh is a fourth, on weapons.

> (Other names not noted in original hand-written notes) 

The conversation goes well, ale flows. We gain a sense of strong trust in these people and confide in them about our true purpose regarding the cult - we think we need allies. This conversation goes well and they know to keep their wits about them.

**NEXT MORNING: AWAY!**

## CARAVAN: The road South

### Caravan day 1

The first day starts quietly, but the afternoon is certainly eventful! A shout from up at the front and a slow stopping (like a wave, running down the long line of caravans) causes us to run forward to investigate. A cart is flipped over, one horse dead with arrows, another scared but being held by the reins by someone; others shelter behind their upturned cart. **Hobgoblins!** They are sniping from nearby trees.

Garren and Gnog decide to split up and run toward the trees from a fair distance apart to draw fire independently. Gnog takes a hit but his rage dulls the impact. The TL;DR of a brief battle against a general and some soldiers is that we don't kill them all for once - we end up in an uneasy conversation in the trees. They are aggressors from the **Urshani** who claim that this is their land; the road was driven through it and now people travel through, in their view plundering the natural resources and attacking Hobgoblins on sight.

It's interesting. These creatures seem to have a legitimate grievance and are neither unintelligent nor unreasonable (this is perhaps his first encounter with technically lawful evil characters, though this particular group might verge more towards neutral but for the tension between them and the "trespassers", as they see them, on the road).

In the end they head back to their village. Gnog vows to one day try and find a way to reconcile things, or at least try.

> (Our characters reach LEVEL 5. On account of Deni and Fee Ree staying back to guard the cart - hidden dragon eggs, after all! - they don't gain the same number of experience points. Over the course of the caravan a disparity does arise due to this, whereas prior experience had been shared equally, so at some later point we pull everyone up to a matched level as a resync).

### Caravan day 2

We meet halfling *Enom Tobun* who's "here to help" (and in due course proves a stalwart figure, held in high regard by our party). The rest of the day is just general chatting, getting a feel for people around and wondering how we'll keep an eye on things, especially those cultists.

That night - technically the next morning, around 5am! - on Gnog's watch, movement is seen. Small cloaked figures are moving surreptitiously, so Gnog decides to wake Deni and we try to stealthily investigate. The characters getting in under the canvas of one of the wagons. Getting closer, Deni manages to grab one while another is dropping something out - hushed whisper of "catch this!" - of the wagon; Gnog catches it instead and our criminals are apprehended... Only...

...it's not jewellery or valuables that the cultists would have; it's just food. Not much of value either, bread and some rather old pastries stolen out of the wagon. Our two hooded figures are **halflings; they are Barri and Jerry**. We quickly realise that these are in fact the two that Losvius Longnose told us about. At this, noticing their hunger & food and believing their story that they just needed to get out of Triboar & seek fortune elsewhere, we offer them employment and a place to sleep in our own wagon. They will run recon on the caravan, keeping tabs on the cultists.

> (This goes well initially but we later realise we'd overdone it, with the halflings becoming well-known and liked by all the caravan but their movements ultimately not unnoticed by the increasingly suspicious cultists and, in the end, this is one of several factors that conspire to blow our cover much later in the journey. It's on Gnog, really, for asking them to check back too often, for fear that if he left it a day or three, then the cult wagons might sneak away and be lost).

### Caravan day 3

After the very early morning excitement, the new day truly dawns and it's more travel, getting to know people - especially our two new travelling companions. We hoped to reach Westbridge today, but it's been slow going and in any event circumstances give us good reason to stop on the road. In the early evening, not long before the caravan was due to park up anyway, there is a hush then a wave of alarm as wagons lurch to a standstill. People point towards the distant Sword Mountains. They are lit golden by the low evening sun and, glittering above Icespire Peak, circling, is an unmistakable shape of a White Dragon.

Alarm at seeing a creature so dangerous as this flying so openly near populated areas, in daylight and, clearly, when it is such a large and therefore old and powerful dragon as to be seen at such distance, spurs us into action. In conjunction with Tobun and Leda our party wagon ushers people off-road to a nearby small woods. People are scared. The elves walk amongst the parked-up wagons, sheltered now out of sight below the branches, playing songs to ease nerves. Strings of candles or, in some cases, magical beads of light give everything a beautiful, fey wild feel; it's a strange, haunting, and very calming atmosphere.

This is a key moment. There is a shift here. People from different wagons mix. Food is shared; stories are exchanged; comfort is found in the company of strangers - and with that, we are strangers no more.

> (This can also be considered the part where we start happily selling, at cost more or less - and sometimes even giving away - drinks in the evenings; over the days we become the 'party wagon' sometimes. This perhaps does at least help solidify our image as actual traders of The Goliath Drinks and turns out to be significant as the campaign continues on much later).

The cult wagons park at the fringes, remaining aloof and standoffish. We approach them and they accept food, but don't join other groups, muttering about preferring to keep to themselves and keep their "minds on the job" of guarding what they claim is just a generically mysterious "valuable cargo".

### Caravan day 4 (Westbridge)

We reach Westbridge early and there is a day of downtime in this waypoint town - buying, selling, or just letting animals rest. Overnight, Barri and Jerry turn out to have been looking around - they sleep strange hours; they'd witnessed some of the clan wagons meeting a group who'd come from the East, loading crates from that East group onto their own now-not-so-empty wagons. We aren't able to determine who this new group are, but they ride back Eastwards after the drop-off.

### Caravan day 5

At around 7am as we're getting ready to leave, we note a group mistreating animals. Gnog's blood boils a bit at it, but he tries to keep focused on their caravan work. He resolves to at least ask Werond Taroha about animal handling and for other tips that might help him make sure his own horses are looked after.

There's soon a distraction - Charlie! They'd had a number of misadventures along the way, their beaten up wagon just about hanging on, the beer fetching some money albeit less than hoped due to the delay at Greenwald - and they'd picked up a traveller. He's an old guy who wants to find family down in Waterdeep; seems a frail but kind gentleman, has some means, and is paying enough to keep Charlin's interest. He is happy enough in the goods wagon, without much in the way of creature comforts. It's a relief to see Charlin's group alive and well, to say the least, and it cheers up our party considerably to know that we'll now be travelling together.

As the day progresses weather worsens. On Charlin's cart, the old man shelters under a tarp, insisting he's OK and refusing offers to shelter, even temporarily, in our properly covered wagon. We suspect a matter of integrity there, too; or perhaps manners; since he's paid for Charlin and wishes to have no debt to another person or, perhaps, to not cause offence to Charlin's group. A curious fellow, this one, but seems genuine.

Barri and Jerry report of a delay further back; Gnog and Fee-Ree investigate, discovering the same group now flogging a horse which has collapsed while the remaining horse isn't looking great either. That's the limit for Gnog and an altercation brews. Some kind of noble is harassing his guard and complaining about the horses; things flare up and a battle ensues. This goes quite badly, since it turns out they have a mage hidden away in their wagon who is pretty high level. We do ultimately prevail, but it's a very sour encounter; there is no redemption here, no good feelings or rescue; we do take the horses (paying for them, but insisting we take them) while the noble basically tells us to just bugger off and leave them alone. Fee-Ree is hurt badly in the altercation (and nearly goes down).

> (This was an interesting soul-searching moment. Gnog picked that fight for what he thought were the right reasons, but he didn't think through the consequences. We do save the horses, but the nobleman's wagon is left at the side of the road & we've also made ourselves very visible indeed to the whole caravan - including the cultists).

### Caravan day 6

We are getting towards Red Larch when we see caravans lurching abruptly to a halt in front of us (already quite close to the front ourselves). We investigate, finding a man in very poor condition _buried up to his neck_ in the dirt of the road itself! He has "Oathbreaker" written on his forehead. Alarmed, we dig him out and get him into the wagon, with a Zone Of Truth spell to see if he's a bad guy or not - but in this process, we spy a Harper's tattoo. A friend, then, but he doesn't know he can trust _us_. After water, healing, food etc. we learn that this man - **Carlon Amoffel** - was indeed also infiltrating the cult, but had been discovered and, well, that's how he ended up buried and left either to die or, given the road's popularity, as a warning. We end up  near the back of the caravan since we had to make sure Carlon was OK before travelling.

As people park up for the night, pulling aside onto the grass, we continue through the group hoping to maybe catch up with our friends the dwarves up front. We pass two attractive ladies at the side of the road who want a lift Southwards; Gnog's kind of oblivious and we have picked up enough strays already between Carlon, Barri and Jerry so we continue along. That night as we set up the for our now-usual "off-the-cart roadside tavern", there is less custom than usual as the two new arrivals are being very charismatic and entertaining, with a small crowd drawn their way. Good looks appear to win you friends quickly on the road!

### Caravan day 7

A pot hole and some bad luck cause one of the cultist's wagons to roll during the day. A crate spills and, while the others of their group of four wagons form up to try and stop anyone interfering, we're able to spy the unmistakable glint of gold. If there was any doubt before, we are now sure that these wagons are working for the cult and carrying plundered valuables.

We hear grim news via Tobun and Werond - two people have gone missing, in addition to the two women from the previous night; TL;DR, we realise that they must have been two shapeshifters who have infiltrated the caravan! There is a suspicion that two other people who appear to be present must, in fact, now have been replaced. There is a very high risk of paranoia and argument so this news is kept quiet. At night, we take up watch as best we can over the whole caravan and manage to spot movement very late - a battle results and we defeat the shapeshifters, who tipped their hand at who they'd turned into from their nightly machinations as they were attempting to dispose of something in sacks.

In those sacks, we make a terrible discovery - **the bodies of Eric & Jemma**, the young eloping couple we met all the way back at Triboar, are found.

> (If the party had paid attention to the two strangely charismatic new arrivals the previous night, we might have uncovered the truth sooner and prevented this tragedy).

In investigating the wagon the shapeshifters had been on, we find plundered personal belongings. We collect them and resolve to do whatever we can to notify the dead couple's families when we reach Red Larch. They are buried in a solemn ceremony within some woods near the road; we carefully note the location.

### Caravan day 8 (Red Larch)

After asking friends in the caravan we elect to stay at the Swinging Sword inn but will visit the Red Larch Rambler tavern for food & drink.

We visit the **Adventurer's Guild** to drop off belongings of Eric & Jemma as well as others found, **leaving 100gp reward for anyone** who can find out where they should be sent. We'll check back in a few weeks (hopefully!). An **Ilithd administrator** manages the jobs!

The next morning, we decide to be tourists! We visit local bookshop **"Gnome It All Books"** to get gifts; a book for Janvair, for example. We also hear of and **visit Llanderei**, a half-elven carver, picking up a beautiful wooden bowl with dragon carvings. Finally, we look in at the small quarry - **One Shield Quarry, run by Jarth One-Shield**. Here we find shards of obsidian from a very pure vein ("Dragon Fire", in history); we get 7, for our Dwarven friends in the caravan.

### Caravan proceeds to Amphail, days 9-12

- 4am on day 10 having camped near The Westwood: Giant spider attack! Big battle. **Deni goes to L5**.
- **DENI'S BIRTHDAY** on caravan day 11 - sixteen (16) years old now - we have learned that Deni's birthday is on the **5th day after the 1st full moon of Autumn**. The caravan circles up to a small, conical hill just South of a larger one on the opposite side of the road from The Westwood. People pitch up on a track that spirals towards the domed top, creating a circle around an open area. The Goliath Drinks opens up & music is started. Deni is happy serving drinks and being merry; it's a great final moment of levity and bonding for this strange group, celebrating not only her birthday, but the nearing of journey's end; we expect Amphail tomorrow, the final big stop before Waterdeep itself.
- The wagons identified as cultists remain sullen and don't really get involved. We kind of know that they are aware we know there's something "different" but don't care so long as they get where they're going - hopefully...

### Caravan day 12 (Amphail)

We get in quite late and after food are asleep in an inn. Barri and Jerri awaken Gnog and we sneak out in the middle of the night; they were on a nighttime wander and take us to some barrels and tarps that give a view of the town square. Cultists.

The four carts we know of are joined by someone we hear is "Jos", a Red Wizard who talks about "aligning" with Rezmir but "only so far". Two cards are being moved away, but there are still four guards; we're not sure who to follow; they know of an East-West trail through Amphail rather than the main Long Road North-South and area heading away using it, West, cutting through the Sword Mountains somehow. We overhear word "Naryta" or "Nareta"; in context, we think it's a person or place that they're going to meet/visit. Four guards still remain.

We realise we've somewhat failed - our heavy-handed approach to keeping an eye on the cultists in the caravan, our unusually powerful levels of intervention in battles with natural hazards of travel and the way that we bonded with so many of the other caravans *except* the cultist wagons - even though we did occasionally try to do so, thinking we'd keep up the ruse - perhaps unsurprisingly had led to them making, somehow, these arrangements to be met at Amphail. Whether this was always the plan or not, we do overhear conversations and know that we now risk losing the wagons. Two seem to continue this way, but two are headed West; we don't know what to follow.

Undetected for now, all we can do is creep away and finish the night's rest.

### Caravan day 13

The next day is downtime but in the evening, we are met by a gnome introducing herself as Jamna Gleamsilver, who has been tapping on our window at the inn. It's a covert meeting; she seems to be a kind of ally, but aligned with the Zhentarim. She has been tracking cultists as they are causing disruption to everyone, whether good or (lawful) evil. Claims that they were coming after us too, right here. Jamna is headed South on a hunch and says she'll leave signs along the way - a black flower - so we can assist if we choose; she gives an example to Deni, hinting that Deni would easily find a place in her organisation (not that we'd want to be part of the Zhentarim from what little we know of it!)

Later as we go for dinner in the inn, we are called into a back room off the main area. We are surprised to find a gathering of:

* Our elven caravan friends, staying at the inn
* The dwarven caravan, staying at the inn
* Representatives of the Harpers, via our friend Carlon Amoffel

At first we are all guarded but soon realise that full disclosure is needed, the Harpers gently facilitating things.

The revelation - all were tasked with tracking cultist wagons, all having the same idea of joining the caravan and all represent different factions (broadly and obviously, elven and Dwarven interests, amongst others). The harpers are aware of the dragon eggs so this ends up revealed to all. There is much discussion once again about destruction or using them, so in the end all we can do is insist we hold on to them, but **we have to leave the caravan here** and will not get to arrive in Waterdeep with our other caravan friends. We need to move faster and track what we can of the cult activity continuing South. So what do we do about the wagon with its heavy eggs and so-on? There is much distrust especially between the conflicting elven and dwarven interests.

After much negotiation, Carlon agrees to act as neutral mediator and safely convey the eggs to Waterdeep along with our horses. He gives us an address where we can find the latter and says the eggs will be kept safe and secure until we return, with no decision made on their use until then. Everyone agrees to trust him.

### Caravan day 14 (leaving the caravan)

Our wagon stock take at this point was:

* The three egg crates
* 2x crates misc books to obfuscate egg crate contents
* 2x casks elven wine, 9 bottles each, 4gp each (consumed or sold now)
* 1x cask mini 60L dwarven ale, 10gp (consumed/sold)
* 1x cask large 128L dwarven ale, 20gp (consumer/sold)
* 2x Triboar mead barrels, 33gp per cask (of which 1 consumed/sold)
* 2x cask Westbridge amber ale 25gp per cask (of which 1 consumed/sold)
* 2x cases West Larch Perry (which comes from East Larch!), 4gp per case (both consumed/sold)
* There is some additional exchange of e.g. a wine skin - equiv 2 bottles - of dwarven ale with 2 bottles of Star Mead and Cider from Amphail

**We get new riding horses and hand over the wagon to Charlin. It's his to look after now. "If you can, wait for us a little while in Waterdeep - but if we don't get there soon, we're probably not coming at all."**

We ride South at speed, on the hunt for signs from Jamna.

### Stalking the cult

On the second night on the road, we're close to Waterdeep. We stay at the Sword Hilt Inn. Still no signs from Jamna; we know to expect more when we're close.

The next morning we approach North Gate. Quite a sight - the road dropping away downhill, wide, busy, lots of buildings of all kinds either side; in the distance the great wall and gate of Waterdeep itself and the sea beyond. It's almost overwhelmingly busy even just here as we get closer and Gnog hasn't seen the sea anywhere near this close before.

We pull to one side and tie the horses, then start sniffing around. Deni spots an unexpected block flower on a side road, which seems to lead us towards a big warehouse. We sneak in & soon spot what we think are the cultist crates - a 5-head "palm"-like logo on some (we only realise later that this is, of course, an intentionally obfuscated and stylised representation of the 5-headed chromatic dragon goddess Tiamat) - but they're being put into larger wagons with other things around them; curiously it mostly seems to be building materials.

After observing for a while, we perceive - Deni especially, who is able to sneak closer easily - general backhanders and other dodgy dealings; it seems that pretty much anyone in this warehouse is at least in on the idea of smuggling *something* in these various big wagons, hidden under other materials; we don't know if they're aware it's a dragon cult or similar.

We spend enough time here to start to learn that they're assembling smaller caravans, 6 wagon groups with 12 guards, heading on the surface to assist with road building along a coast road, for **Lord Neverember**. The destination is something called the "**Carnath Roadhouse**" for transfer of goods (and by transfer, we get the strong impression that this will be where the cult crates only are unloaded). In particular, this warehouse is under governance of the **High Road Charter Co.** and the longer we stay here, the more we become convinced that they are all really fully aware of who and what is going on and this entire operation is a big part of the cult activities, all carried out covertly, but within the warehouse itself apparently without much fear of oversight or being overheard. They are not being at all careful with their words.

By means of various investigations, assisted by the occasional appearance of a flower from Jamna at some key junction or carefully hidden near doorways, with often only Deni able to perceive and find them, we work our way in to an administrative building that covers operations of various contracted entities that are assisting with the road work.

A very stressed guard captain (name not recorded! Aww) is assembling security details from an office off to one side of the building. We have to risk trust here - we tell her, in brief, what we know; we have seen all the 'help wanted' posters around; we offer ourselves as security, ideally for any groups from High Road Charter. That isn't possible as they're self contained - and indeed, reflecting on how they always seem to have enough people when everyone else always seems short, the guard captain gains confidence in our story and confesses that she'd always had doubts, but the corporations they use are supposed to be vetted by Lord Neverember himself. He's a lord of Waterdeep and Neverwinter - we learn that he's trying to rebuild and repair the coastal route between the two cities, it's a bit of a pet project and he might well be so distracted by having to manage so many roles that he's overlooked important details.

So we end up with one better. The currently-assembling cultist group isn't due to leave for another day or two, but there's a caravan that wants to leave urgently yet lacks guards. We'll fit the bill! Funny old world...

A contract is hastily drawn up & we agree. We really *are* guards for this group, no messing around; it's a means to an end for us both. We get to head out to the roadhouse and investigate, while she gets another set of supplies safely over. Meanwhile, she'll push harder to get better investigations and vetting from Neverember or deputies, as she's got much more reason to be confident in her own prior suspicions now. We learn:

* Carnath is out in the Mere of Dead Men. We get a brief rundown but the TL;DR is - awful, very dangerous, be on your guard and once you've entered *do not stop*.
* If we reach Carnath after 6pm, then stay the night - never travel the Mere in the dark unless you're already trapped in there with no choice. If you reach it with time enough to turn around, then caravans are usually told to do so; drop goods at the staging area and hurry back.
* The coast road before that is wild and can be treacherous. Be on guard at all times. Banditry is less common, but natural hazards abound.

Since transport is provided and, since the Harper-supplied horses were given with instructions on how to return them, we are able to find a place (with assistance from the guard captain) to hand them over so that they'll be returned to the correct place.

### The coast road: Days 4-8

It's wild, indeed. Steep cliff dropoffs are sometimes unnervingly close. Steep cliffs on the other side are often unclimbable. Each night we find carefully placed inns with taverns, self-contained rest stops at 1-day travel for caravan speed groups, with facilities for parking up wagons and stabling horses. They're all basic & the company is very gruff & businesslike, but they're dry and warm, unlike outside.

On the fourth day we're at the Jagged Teeth Overlook, with dramatic views over the very treacherous rocks that stretch for miles along this part of the coast. By the 6th night we're past Thornhold, a strange, very remote, but dramatic looking city/town clinging to the lip of the coast, treacherous seas all around, difficult to access by track - mostly sea access only.

On the 8th night, there is a night-time attack of Perytons. They're trying to grab horses and, if given a chance, people. We fight well, roping up hastily after the rude awakening from alert watch-members of our wider caravan guard party, but it's a scary situation against flying creatures in the dark. One guard is killed.

### The coast road: Day 9 (The Mere of Dead Men -> Carnath Roadhouse)

In we go. Mist, fog, bog, rivers to ford; for a while we're on the rebuilt road and proceed with caution but with relative ease, with well-made pavement and lights that we are told burn with a heatless flame all day and night with no need for fuel; some kind of clever magic. Then the new road ends. The old road is more or less derelict and often just mud, at times the trail disappearing completely under rivers where we must swim. Getting horses and wagons across is painstaking and exhausting.

In the early afternoon we encounter three trolls. The battle is brutal. We're wanted for food; there's no negotiation here. We cannot but feel terrible, though, when after finally whittling down two of the trolls and dispatching them in short order of each other, the third wails in anguish at the death and claims we have killed its siblings; enraged it redoubles its attack. We are hurt badly but prevail. No guards are lost; they kept back at our order, fighting at range, holding the horses steady and protecting the carriages.

So much for not being there after dark. Night is falling. We finally drag ourselves into Carnath gone 9pm, with a level of exhaustion all round. We find a small company of guards for wagons already here, themselves having been delayed, arriving just before dark the same day with not enough time to turn around, so waiting it out overnight. There's a 1/2 Orc leader of the Carnath Road House with the unlikely name of Bog Luck who starts ordering the unloading of wagons into a store room. He doesn't seem interested in any kinds of conversations and just points us in the direction of rooms where people can hang out.

A little latter, at a dinner in a mess hall, Deni is accosted. A lady approaches our table and accuses Deni of murdering her sister! There is talk of the inn and time where we met Jamna, with this woman's sister apparently murdered in an alley near there. The sister had apparently been sending letters about being followed by some rogue-like woman, small in size; young Deni isn't too far from matching the description; we aren't sure, but we suspect that Jamna was - as one might suspect! - not telling the full truth. The cult were tracking us, even to that inn, she said? So perhaps Jamna seen a cultist there and perhaps killed them, before or after her visit.

We aren't able to easily ask about it. We don't want to reveal what we know about the cult. We do not we even know if the lady we're faced with here is a cultist herself or aware of (potentially, if we're right) her sister's involvement. We've been framed, inadvertently or deliberately, by Jamna it seems, unless it's all just an unlikely coincidence. We do our best to de-escalate but the lady stabs Deni suddenly. Deni flees the room; chase is given; there's a brief battle with the rest of our party acting in defence, with Deni easily fast enough to keep out of harm's way. The lady is knocked out.

Bog Luck wasn't too friendly when we arrived and he's even less friendly now. We're ordered to our rooms and told to stay there until morning.

Surprisingly, we're not in barracks; instead, two 2-bed rooms, side by side, at the far end of a corridor. Maybe easier to keep an eye on us and keep us isolated? After a couple of hours or so, a knock at the door; Deni and Fee-Ree. They'd noticed that someone was keeping an unsubtle watch on our doors but they'd gone away; perhaps to bed? Anyway - yeah - we're not going to take this lying down. Nighttime skulking! We look around in the courtyard; we overheard strange noises while in our rooms from there; a store room area in the corner. We check it out. Nothing too strange, but we don't see enough things in here given how much we'd expect given two companies of wagons recently arrived. More investigations; evidence of things being dragged around, not too surprising. Rats making some noise. Then no rats - where did they go?! We discover a craftily-hidden small partition door, with a much smaller space behind that divides the store room up. You'd have to be paying close attention outside to notice the difference between apparent sizes in and out. Crates and sacks were piled to hide it, but the rat gave it away; the broken wood at the door's bottom edge allowed it access.

The small space has a few crates and lots of straw - all crates with the cultist emblem. Not subtle, but we realise with a bit of a shock that they're not even trying to be now. They're everywhere, it seems; at scale, a full warehouse just outside Waterdeep and who knows what else. Things are escalating. We uncover almost by accident - tripping on the metal ring - a trap door under the straw. Under it, a dark hole and wet tunnel that leads somewhere. It's pitch dark and we need to rest after the very long journey here. Tomorrow, we'll find a way.

### The coast road: Day 10 (Carnath Road House -> Naerytar)

In the morning, we're woken early by a lot of noise and muffled shouts of orders etc. from outside. Moments later there's a knock on Gnog & Garren's door. A guardsman from our group called Ardred. It turns out he's aware of the cult issue, told by the guard captain as he's more trusted by her than we are (which is reasonable!). Bog Luck, he claims, is in league; he could hardly run this place and not know about goods being smuggled through here. It's probably just for cash not cause but that doesn't matter to us. Ardred says we should watch our back; Bog Luck is unlikely to treat us well... They have to leave immediately to get back on the road to Waterdeep again. Another caravan has just arrived, he warns - the cultists that were behind us! The fools tried to travel at night, with heavy casualties, two wagons lost and many injured.

We can't wait. We wish Ardred and his group well and hope he has a rapid and safe passage back. We thank him deeply for his warning - it probably has saved our lives. We get Deni and Fee-Ree, already also awake from the noise, only just having recovered enough from the sleep we got; we're going to use the distractions as cover. We pick a moment when Bog Luck is out of the courtyard perimeter and out of sight to march out; Deni stealths into the store room ahead of us; the rest of us just start helping lift materials into the "main" store room, without really talking to people; it's just assumed that we're meant to do so. There's a moment when nobody else is present, so we immediately push to the side the sacks that let us crawl into the back room, pulling things in behind us again, having set things up to make this easier during our nighttime excursion. We push away the straw, open the trapdoor and hastily get down the ladder into the tunnel. We do our best to try and close the trapdoor in a way that'll maybe blow the straw around a bit and hide it such as we found it, but fear that it might be very obvious someone has come along and gone down here. Cultists might not be far behind us.

The tunnel is what you'd expect. Dark, dank and very wet, with some sections looking especially unsafe; it's not really cut through rock, more a sort of peat with occasional bits of shored-up roof with timbers that look like they'd have barely been fit for purpose when new - and they're far from new now; or just look older than they are due to the dampness and decay around.

Ahead we hear strange voices and freeze. We realise that somehow there is a group ahead; more than one voice; Fee-Ree understands some of it. Lizard people of some kind, complaining about having to do what the cult tell them. Some kind of hold over them; working under duress. We hear again **Naerytar** and, in that language, the penny drops (as does the correct equivalent spelling in Common). It _is_ a place not a person - a castle - and it's somewhere in the mere.

We eventually emerge from the tunnel on a low island of sorts, surrounded by boggy water. A trail leads ahead. We carefully proceed, eventually catching sight of a group of departing Lizardfolk, using canoes. Other canoes are tied in a reed bed, some rotted, but one in good condition and one we can repair. The Lizardfolk are out of sight but we follow the way they went. Gnog manages to see through the eyes of a willing bird (waterfowl) which flies up, helping us navigate the maze-like waterways. We eventually emerge from reedbank-hemmed channels into the edge of an open area and realise quickly that we need to pull in and stealth out onto the bank - because not far away, on the other side of the channel, is a Lizardfolk encampment - and a huge, imposing, dark castle. **We've actually stumbled upon Castle Naerytar itself**. 

We try to work our way around, to see if we can get closer without crossing the open water or wide areas of no-cover land around the castle. It's looking very difficult, but right when we're really getting concerned, we turn back to see if the canoe might be an option and almost walk straight into a Lizardfolk person who had been tracking us. Didn't expect us to turn around. Everyone freezes... All we can do is hope that - "We think we might be able to help agains the cult" - will be enough.

And it is, because to our astonishment, this is an ally and it's the presence of Dragonborn Fee-Ree that clinched it. This is Snapjaw, who assumes Fee-Ree is in charge of our party and we're happy to go along with that. She's like them - not smooth/fleshy-skinned - so we don't just get killed on the spot. Indeed, there's always been talk of the gods providing a hero who would liberate their people from the cult oppression. That's the key! They're not just _grumbling_ about the cult; they hate them, but in turn they also hate people who aren't lizard-like. A justifiable xenophobia that's always been present culturally but is amplified by their experiences.

They want help. And it won't be easy. They worship a strange god; **the black dragon Voaraghamanthar**. A long name means an older, more powerful dragon. It guarded the Mere, keeping their lands free, but then started to behave erratically and the cultists ultimately appeared, apparently having some kind of hold over the dragon. The Lizardfolk would either comply or be destroyed by their own supposed protector (knowing the evil nature of a chromatic black dragon, protection is unlikely; perhaps more likely that the dragon just used the area around for hunting and wasn't interested in small prey?)

We are later led covertly to a hut where we anxiously await a meeting with a tribe chief and related leaders. It's a several hours until it convenes; late afternoon. It's a tense meeting, but Fee-Ree's presence and its fortunate alignment with a rescue mythology helps our cause and we are convincing in our dislike of the cult, along with our evident power from the artefacts and weapons we carry.

We learn that:

* The cultists attracted and employed the services of "Bullywogs", frog-men, that act in essence as slave masters. They treat the Liardfolk very badly.
* The castle is now run by a **1/2 elf Dralmorrer Borngray** who they don't particularly mind. Not bad, but not good either? Snapjaw doesn't quite understand the question, but we from what he does say, we suspect some neutrality there perhaps.
* They'll help us storm the castle, but we *must* kill various Bullywogs that guard a main entranceway and patrol the walls above. The Lizardfolk say they could never get past that area as the Bullywogs would rain down death from the walls above.

Plans are drawn up. Tomorrow morning, we attack!

### The coast road: Day 11 (The Battle For Castle Naerytar)

It's on. A dramatic, huge battle begins. Ostensibly led to the gates as prisoners, we have an element of surprise and cut down the front gate Bullywogs from inside. We get up to the walls and, in all, take out 12 of them. The lizardfolk give a rallying cry and run inside.

We end up in a side tower. There are crates of books all over. In one area is a library; we only have time for a brief investigation, but (by a lucky very high roll) we learn what could be vital information. We'd been so worried as a party about how we might escape this. We have no way to travel back through the Mere, we risk being murdered at the Roadhouse; now we're deep in the swamp - but through an open journal we learn that **there's a portal in the dungeon and its command word is Draezir**. It's astonishing that someone wrote that down, but it seems that dealing with "unwilling help" across a wide spectrum of intelligence perhaps leads to a need for more rigorous instructions and documentation!

At first, things seem to be going well. We hear battle raging below and continue up this tower. We hope to find a leader, someone to take out; the black dragon "controller", whoever it might be. Maybe this Rezmir we hear about sometimes?

There are riches here, but mostly nothing we can carry - two giant beautiful jade statues of lions stand as pillars at the end of bannisters atop one flight of stairs leaving above the library, for example. Deni's eyes light up! But they're far too heavy to carry or put in the Bag Of Holding.

We get to a room that might well be Rezmir's, or at least a person of importance. It is a bedroom, with a wardrobe that's locked by some very powerful magic. The odd cultist guard is surprised along the way, but we make short work of them. We're not given or giving much opportunity to dissuade people from battle, but it's still a bit grizzly, even for a Goliath warrior like Gnog. At least there is a prize here we can take, to help weaken the cult - justification enough! - a beautiful jade statuette of a dragon with gems for eyes.

Now Gnog makes a critical error. Deni is very unsure if she can unlock it. Gnog encourages her to try. She does, but **a trap is sprung** - and it's a bad one. The room fills with billowing clouds of **acidic gas**. It harms us all very badly; even Deni's fast reactions only help her a certain amount given she was so close to the source of the blast. Our equipment is damaged and anything we might've taken from the room is completely destroyed. And when we then open the cupboard? Intact in perfect condition - **a set of ornamental priest robes for a cultist. That's all it was protecting**. We take them.

Our priorities change. We've held up our part of the bargain and, what's more, learned from what we've seen and overheard in shouts from cult guards that anyone important has already left. While we'd intended to battle further and help the Lizardfolk more, we're now really beaten up and we might just need to seek self-preservation at this point. The portal is our new target, with most of the castle still unexplored.

We make our way down the tower, with more skirmishes due to the noise of the trap we sprung. As we emerge from the base door into the courtyard - it's chaos. Battle rages, Lizardfolk vs other cultists. The battle seems to be in the Lizardfolk's favour, perhaps because anyone powerful already fled? Curious that they might abandon this place so easily - the dragon might be the key - we just don't have a way to know.

We intend to hug the inner wall of the courtyard aiming for a door further along. We get inside and take stock. What? Where's Fee-Ree?! Somehow in the confusion (perception & stealth roll combinations in practice) we missed her. She's outside, fighting for her life! We run out and manage to stage a rescue, with more damage taken; Fee-Ree is extremely shaken up. We get back into the side room but we end up pinned inside there. There's another exit, but it's boarded up. Gnog smashes a board out of the door with his greataxe and we see lots of cultists beyond in some kind of dining room - an arrow narrowly misses us through the hole!

Trapped. Fee-Ree sighs and without saying anything, casts a fireball through the gap. There's a giant explosion, smoke billows out, screams. We break down the door and head inside. Death and destruction - not a single survivor - these look like lower level cultists than guards. Fee-Ree just kind of gets completely introverted; we realise this is a horrible reminder of how she and Arxcis ended, with her wild magic source destroying everything and killing him in a big explosion.

There is no time for introspection - it must wait. We press on. A hallway leads beyond and there are stairs down. So much for the castle - good luck to the Lizardfolk, truly, we hope they prevail and reclaim their land - down we go.

Catacombs. Choices of route. Our choice leads to **Pharblex**, leader (self-proclaimed king?) of the Bullywogs. He's in a kind of temple; we end up in battle, inevitably. He's surprisingly powerful. We do prevail, but the final tally after all this is quite horrendous:

* 12 bullywogs initially
* 11 guards from various skirmishes
* 16 lower level cultists from the fireball
* 12 more bullywogs in the catacombs
* Pharblex himself

The battle even includes a moment where we use a spell scroll we'd acquired. It was intended to create a bubble or shell of protection to keep enemies out, but we realise it can just as well keep them in! It is used to keep a few of the aggressors off our back until we have capacity to deal with them.

In Pharblex's shrine, we discover various magic items from presumed-murdered mages. It seems Pharblex, with no apparent magical ability innately, believed he could gain magical powers from artefacts and spell books - of which there are two, high level, here. These are ridiculously useful to the right people and command a very high price, but could be equally dangerous in the wrong hands. We cannot read them, but we take them, intending to sell on or otherwise "make safe" at Waterdeep - should we ever get back.

An adjoining passageway and cavern leads to increasing amounts of mist. We reach what appears to be a terminus / ending, but a curious chamber and we're sure this must be "it" - we blow and waft and otherwise wish we had a some kind of wind-blowing spell (!) to clear the mist as best we can; sure enough, a teleportation circle. Fee-Ree makes a copy of the runes as best she can. They're "custom"; she copies as best she can but doesn't fully understand their form or language basis. Some are completely alien.

Do we risk it? What choice do we have...

"**Draezir**"

...and we're unconscious. We awake rapidly, disorientated and sickened. We're not sure how much time has passed but it doesn't seem like long. The lighting of the location however is odd; it's not the right time of day; just how far did we go? Where are we?

**Looking around, we see a distant lodge of some kind**. Maybe a hunting lodge of sorts. The grounds we're in are quite extraordinary. No less than five teleportation circles are here, with paths leading to the lodge. We've arrived on one of them. As we get our bearings, we spot movement on the lodge roof - and suddenly see two perytons, presumably nesting or otherwise waiting up there, swooping in to attack! We run towards a nearby treeline intending to attack from there, but once we're in the trees the perytons appear to lose interest, apparently not intending to attack with such a disadvantage. They return to the lodge roof.

Investigations ensue, but only by talking the "long way around" the trees. We can't risk being in the open for many reasons, not just the perytons. We can see that we're amongst mountains, with some areas of unmelted snow dotted around, so quite high. The lodge seems to be in a natural wooded bowl, the centre cleared; there's an access road which curves away down, following the mountain flank, out of sight. We discover a strange large stables building, too big for horses; we're not sure what it would be for. The perytons do indeed have a nest on the roof, so it's not them, though we have no way to know if they are just naturally attacking when we approach, or are trained/somehow enslaved to protected the lodge.

We find a spot further down the road and off in the woods where it's safe to camp; we can't be seen from lodge or road. We're beaten up from battle; we don't know how long we were unconscious after the portal, but nobody else seemed to have found us and it "felt" like it should still not be too late in the day, yet our hour or two of investigative prowling have led to the sun almost meeting the ridgeline above the bowl in which the lodge rests - it's going dark and getting very cold.

It's a sombre evening. Gnog tries to hunt, but while he finds animal tracks, he finds no evidence of animals at all; perhaps the perytons have eaten everything; or perhaps some larger creature, even a dragon - it's scary but we can't do anything about it if so, thus, no point worrying! Camp is established. A watch is set up, a small fire is kept and we sleep.

(NEXT NOTE: Campaign One: Part Two (Gnog: 1.2))
