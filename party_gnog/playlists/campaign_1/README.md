# Campaign One

Introducing goliath barbarian Arrin "Gnog" Ogolakanu, human paladin Garren Bronson, human rogue Deni Tumble and dragonborn sorceress Fee-Ree Jharthraxyn.



## Part 1
### In The Beginning

A misfired teleport onto a storm-swept mountain leads to an unexpected awakening and, from that, a friendship that will endure beyond life itself. Brought together by fortune, a small group forms. Bonds grow strong and the future looks bright - but for a hint of shadow on the far horizon.



## Part 2
### Hoard Of The Dragon Queen

A dragon's attack draws the group into intrigue and danger. Their path takes them to places of which dreams - or perhaps nightmares - are made. From land to sky, battles are fought and friendships made. A path is charted to a darker future, but beyond that darkness lies hope.

All source material heavily adapted and extended by integrating existing in-world lore an introducing an increasingly large cast of recurring characters.
