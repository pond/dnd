# Part 1
## Interplanar

Reunited with Gnog and his party, we catch up some months on. The world is damaged from the war, so healing of both land and people is needed. Deni returns from University and we start, as we had pledged to do, our search for Fee-Ree's husband Arxcis. We could never possibly have imagined where it might take us.



# Part 2
## Interplanetary

Wildspace! We learn of the Astral Sea, planet-destroying foes, rebellion forces and land on our first new world. A new party member is found and he will change our lives forever. Our travels continue far, until we finally set down on the city planet of Ravnica.



# Part 3
## Learning

What is the IPB? What is the ongoing significance of the red crystals? And what happens if you break the law on Ravnica? We find out the last question the hard way. We learn of guilds, make new friends, make important alliances; but overall, the mystery deepens.



# Part 4
## Gathering

Nivix, at last. A new party gathers as Planeswalkers are called; the IPB's astonishing purpose is revealed. Realising great danger is at hand, we urge the evacuation of Ravnica Station but it seems we may be too late...



# Part 5
## Negotiating

Ajani joins us and the Gruul become allies, but it is a fragile situation. Friends and enemies are made amongst the Golgari. We learn of the dark events on the world of Amonkhet; and eventually, it becomes known that all Guilds most work together to avert a diaster of almost incomprehensible scale. The guild meeting is called, but murder is afoot and suddenly, all plans seem shattered and hope lost - almost.



# Part 6
## Falling

Despite our joy at finding a friend, the situation starts to spiral out of control on Ravnica. The Disruptor is moved to the Decamillennial Platform and is pressed into service quickly repelling attacks from Amonkhet. At least the Orzhov issues seem mostly resolved but just as hope starts to rise, Ravnica's darkest hour is upon us. Bolas breaks through, death and destruction rains uopn us, and all are forced to flee to the Undercity.



# Part 7
## Reeling

It is the darkest, most desperate of times, but Ravnicans rise to the challenge and the long war begins. Lines are held for a time - until the harvest starts. The terrible truth of the Immortal Sun is realised too late; the trap has been sprung and we are caught within it; our party must trust in the friends and alliances made and takes a desperate gamble to travel to Amonkhet, to close the bridge at its source.



# Part 8
## Retaliating

After making the most difficult decision Gnog's ever made, the situation on Amonkhet settles somewhat and plans are drawn. Many battles must be fought and the odds seem hopeless, but bit by bit, plans form. Taz achieves an astonishing feat of magic and songs not heard for centuries are now sung once again. With all the pieces in place, the battle plan is executed - can the bridge be closed in time to prevent the fall of Ravnica and, thereafter, the fall of all things?



# Part 9
## Sacrifices

An extraordinary encounter on the Astral Sea gives rise to new chances and new hope, but also forces a terrible, terrible choice. By the time the party reaches Ravnica, the situation is undeniably grave but the Ravnicans continue to hold on with stoic determination. A new weapon is created and an impossible plan drawn up to steal an object of great power - without anyone knowing.



# Part 10
## This Is The End

The final battle, in which many will lose their lives. Who will make it, and what will this world look like by the end?

With so many threads, the last few chapters are a very, very long goodbye (eat your heart out, Lord Of The Rings). What does the future hold for those who survived and are so changed by their experiences? Taz gets the last word on that!
