# Gnog: Part 2.x - Battling Chuth

Our heroes are goliath Gnog, self-styled fanboy of Grog (of Critical Role fame), but lighter, shorter, too clever for his own good and a reluctant wanderer away from his clan (Grog's fall from grace made Gnog's idolisation a little less - uuh - fashionable); along with his best friends Garren, human paladin of Helm; teenage rogue Deni; and the brass dragonborn wild magic sorceress, Fee Ree.

Together, we have been through a lot - all the way from level 1 through to recently-acquired level 10, based on experience rather than milestones. After some adventures that got everyone together, we ended up embroiled with the dragon cult and we've played every step of the way, even day by day on their slow caravan route from Triboar to - *almost*, since they didn't quite get all the way there at the time - Waterdeep (which turned out to be one of the richest and most rewarding parts of our journey). If I were to write down our stories leading to this point, it would fill a book. Some day, maybe I will.

Right now, though, we're fighting Chuth, an old green dragon with rider who's holed up in the Misty Forest & been routing the elves there. You probably know the one. We've not got much choice but to fight in his lair, accessed by an underwater passageway that looked too risky to try and swim; but through some RP & slightly permissive DMing on persuasive conversations that I kinda sucked at ðŸ˜… with other characters in there, we also found the rider's chambers and secret alternative lair access, which smaller creatures can use.

We've managed to time our arrival so that Chuth is not in the cavern at the time. It was still busy in there; we already had to chop our way through some etins & a load of cultists in two battles, with a third big battle of giant spiders on the way to get to the cavern in the first place. We hold back on any big spells for the casters to use on the dragon, get in a short rest at least, burn a load of hit dice, and prepare for the dragon to return. We are brand new to Level 10, have poison resistance through various means and most of us have ways to resist Frightful Presence but it's still obviously gonna suck - the rider is said to be almost as powerful as the dragon, there's nobody else to help, it's a party of four and we're in his lair.

We have one fast rogue party member brave enough to act as a forward-warning in the main chamber that leads to the exit, who's hoping to get a shot at the dragon as it enters, then scamper down to warn us as the dragon clambers through and gets into its swimming passage. As rider and dragon emerge, we'll be ready. This warning is important as a low initiative roll for Gnog could do serious damage, as he won't be able to rage; so we wan't to get the jump on that - there's only one rage left to try and deal with both rider and dragon.

Goliath and Garren stand side by side to face the dragon and distract it. Caster and rogue will hide in the side tunnel secret entrance on a fire-and-run strategy, while we try and be the tanks. They'll deal most damage while we do what we can to keep it distracted. A 60ft ceiling means we're unlikely to do much once it's off the ground as we have no range to speak of, so it'll be on the caster & rogue. That's all we have as plan.

The dragon is overdue. Half an hour passes... An hour... Gnog farts quietly. Garren farts loudly in competition.

Now, our plans usually start to go awry quite early on in battles, but this takes the biscuit. We hear our rogue friend running down the secret passageway hollering that the dragon is here and "he's chasing me!", and it takes a second for us to realise that this means the rider since the dragon can't fit. And with a sudden benefit of hindsight, we remember tales from destroyed elven villages of the rider jumping off onto platforms to fight pretty much for fun, while his dragon continues to mess stuff up other by itself. Ah - yes - he's a jumpy guy.

Our spell caster, realising a bad guy is coming down the very passageway that's meant to be safe, dashes out and stands directly behind us - we're there to be tanks and distraction, keeping the dragon away from the rogue and caster at all costs, but before we even engage we're suddenly looking over our shoulders and about to say "why are you there?!" when the dragon bursts in, hauling itself out of the water, towering over us and roaring with Frightful Presence.

We're all stood next to a Level 10 Paladin at this point, so we give it capybara face.

Well, that's the most messed up one our plans ever got, about as early as it ever has. We're about to try and engage when our caster has a genius idea and casts fly at L5, so the tanks are up in the air just as the dragon gives us a century of bad breath and knocks a big chunk out of everyone's hit points. Everyone except the goliath manage their saves and have resistance on top of that, and the goliath is raging so takes a big chunk but still only half.

The dragon is lifting off; the two kind-of-tanks follow, using the 3D space to be able to flank it directly left and right. We take swipes and in a moment of Dice God Realism, despite flanking advantage both miss wildly on our first swings - we're flying, it's new to us! - but get good hits in the second. Average to middling damage rolls but it's a start. Downdraft from the wings does manage to push us away, but we're in the air so we aren't knocked prone, just thrown downwards. We get back into combat range quickly enough with a few hefty chunks taken out by bites and claws and all that usual "fun stuff". The rogue is doing some damage while trying to keep at distance and an ice storm works pretty well, so we're worrying it; our idea is to annoy it enough to just give up on this minor lair & leave, as killing it should be near impossible. But while it's doing its various legendary things, our rogue, experienced at this now, has been counting the dragon's actions carefully.

In just combat round two, judging that the dragon can't shrug off the damage, our rogue pulls out one of her only two arrows of dragon slaying, takes aim without moving, and with two other people flanking the dragon, fires. Rolls for the attack and, like a cheesy moment in a film where things slow down and an unlikely event occurs - natural 20.

After about 10 minutes of a bazillion dice being counted up, it's not actually that great a damage roll for a crit with that many modifiers, but it still takes a huge chunk and that's enough - the dragon wants to flee. So it lifts up, immediately triggering an attack of opportunity from the goliath and paladin. Gnog gets a good hit with the greataxe that does a little extra damage on anything two sizes larger than him, and the paladin spent **all our damned money** (we're down to just double digits gold, yet this is at level 10 remember) on a dragon slaying sword that does an extra 3d6. Swings, rolls just high enough, gets lucky with his damage roll...

...and that's a dead dragon.

After that, the rider really wasn't much bother. We killed off the dragon so fast that he'd only just got into the cavern and due to us all ending up in the air hadn't been able to quite make range for any of his big attacks. While he did get a good poison cloud in on Gnog and Garren, we were able to capture him & load up on as much treasure as we could. Not ours though - had to be returned to the elves.

As for the unexpected battle just two days later with a young Red out of Daggerford - well, that's another story.



## Our revenge on Lennithon

Lennithon the blue dragon is attacking the town of Xonthal's Tower.

The day before, when first arrived in the area, the party had just finished a horrible encounter at Thay. Things were looking dark, we were tired, frayed; we weren't sure of our own alignment, our compromises, or sure of any chance of victory against the Cult of the Dragon. But this pretty little town - if you ignored the strange tower and its maze - reminded us of home. The foot of the mountains, a clean cold feel to the air, the evergreen trees, snow covered peaks... We found an inn, got directed to a tavern, met and immediately became endeared with a would-be dreamer-adventurer called Yarrow who was on the threshold of having saved up enough money to finally buy his very own sword, and quite literally danced the night away. It was beautiful.

In the morning we tackled the maze and the tower. We were very lucky with the maze, guessing well and avoiding _any_ encounters - a missed player opportunity perhaps, but good for party hit points! - although we had a rougher ride in the tower itself. Once we'd made our way to the dungeon, we stayed on target, following a trail of blood. Once that became too hard to follow, our usual "keep to the left wall" strategy worked wonders. Blue mask acquired - seemed legit - but we were too late for Iskander. We could almost feel sorry for the cruel nature of his lonely demise, despite his cult affiliations. Unfortunately, we got back outside and saw smoke rising from the town.

With the dragon taking a wide, very high swooping pass around the tower before coming about for a second pass over the township, we ran out to our horses and galloped as fast as we could to try and get within _any_ kind of weapon or spell range. We hoped to divert it away from them and to us, and then we'd - um - we'd think of _something_.

Our party has quite weak ranged attacks and Lennithon wasn't stupid enough to get close, but we had some luck even with disadvantages and weak weaponry. As the dragon reached the bottom curve of an attacking dive, he had an unexpected failed save against the glancing edge of a fireball which forced him to use up some of his innate powers of resistance. Yeah - _that_ got his attention. Lennithon wasn't getting his breath weapon back and eventually he dropped down lower to do the wing beat thing. Gnog got a good saving throw and, with the dragon's lowest altitude being 20ft and within horizontal charging range, Gnog tried a run-and-jump attack. Rolled very well on a couple of athletics checks, got just one swing of the axe, only average damage, rolled a natural 1 on the landing. Splat! Down like a sack of spuds. Oof.

A couple of "throw everything we've got at it no matter how high level or costly" in-initiative-order ranged hits from our party later, and the dragon was running out of options. Still no breath weapon, getting low on everything else. We found out later that it fell just below its "flee" threshold and used some remaining movement to start to turn and fly out. The dragon only achieves a little more altitude as it flies over our paladin Garren who on his turn goes for it - jumps up as high as he can, gets a good result for that from dice rolls, then Misty Steps at maximum range to just above the dragon's back.

Garren now rolls a lucky natural 19 with +7 on the athletics check to land on the back of the dragon. He's just showing off now. He gets both of his two attacks. The first roll is mid-range but hits, with a high level divine smite totalling 35 damage. Second attack is declared to use a maximum level divine smite, but he rolls a 2! As players, we claim that the first hit had made the dragon twist around, throwing Garren off balance, but by sheer luck as he's flailing around he swings the sword wild and... ...I spend a luck point to see the outcome.

Amazingly, it's like the Chuth battle - a cheesy-movie-timing natural fucking 20. We play with the "roll twice" rather than "roll once and double" rule and the second roll is lower, but even so, when all the modifiers and features and other stuff is bundled in, it comes to a huge 85 points of damage yielding a total, in one player's turn, of a ridiculous *120 points* of damage. That's almost double the party's previous best ever.

The outcome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w92RLWYzSOE

Fuck you, Lennithon. That's for Greenest, for trying to fuck over the Xonthal's Tower township, for almost killing off our new mate Yarrow and for just generally being a dick.

Our next problem is how the hell to carry the wings back to Waterdeep...



## Our end

Gnog is 95 years old. He is sat in his favourite chair at Eliastra's house. She is holding his hand and he squeezes it while smiling at her. He sees that his friends are gathered around. Their presence makes him feel warm and comforted.

It might take a few hundred years, but Eli and Gnog are both sure that they will meet again.

Gnog's eyes close, and he starts his final journey.
