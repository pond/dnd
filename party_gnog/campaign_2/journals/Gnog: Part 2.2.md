# Gnog: Part 2.2
## Waterdeep

We have found and captured Vallum, with the White Dragon mask, in the Serpent Hills; a teleportation scroll brings us - and our horses - back to Waterdeep.

### Day 1: Harper's Chapterhouse

The less said about our arrival the better. Funnily enough, it turns out that bringing horses into a small portal room, a few flights of stairs above sea level, is not the wisest plan. **Chaos ensues** - not least because one horse is particularly disorientated by the rather rough teleport and empties its stomach in a corner! Two are persuaded, very shakily, to take the stairs - though there is a cost in the form of one or two probably very rare and expensive ornamental vases in small alcoves along the way which the horses bump into - and worse, we are forced to cast a Fly spell on the others. They're pulled downstairs like balloons.

Once we get outside, we tie the horses. Two stand normally - and two float above the ground, looking very confused, but surprisingly not too distressed now that they're outside. Even more surprisingly, most passers-by seem to barely even raise an eyebrow at the surely unusual and ludicrous sight of two confused, floating horses - just another day in Waterdeep, apparently!

With damages paid for and Varrum taken away into custody, we are surprised to be called for in the foyer. Varja's grey guard. We are summoned to her. We head outside and follow into an alleyway...

...something is wrong. A cold, creeping sensation...

...watched...

...dread. DREAD, and great danger! The four of us shout warnings and shout that we munst *FLEE*. Whatever this is, insight indicates something beyond - beyond *us*; we don't quite understand but we can't fight what we can't see and we're in no mood to battle something from "beyond", from the undead, or from whatever this feeling is.

We run, they gallop; we got to a main street. We get to Vajra, safely. That's one time, it seems, that running was the right thing to do.

Vajra is mostly concerned with the recount of something getting into Waterdeep - that kind of incursion should not be possible. She has the White Dragon Mask (White Mask) and we give her the dragon horn we've been carrying. She thinks she can make a wand with it, but we'll check back later.

From here, it's a whirlwind of procedure. The horses - now all safely on four hooves on the ground - are walked to The Goliath Drinks and stabled there. With requisite greetings made, we get down to some much-needed trading. It's a strange and sudden shift from the wilds of the Serpent Hills and the catacombs below, but it seems, as we start to get more used to these trips and our increasing abilities, that we take it more in our stride now. Even the *whatever it was* that tried to reach us on our way to Vajra.

We don't take it for granted though. These experiences, both good and bad, are truly extraordinary. We doubt our lives will ever be the same after all this, but that really doesn't seem a bad thing.

* We pick up the falchion from Balthor's - another fine piece of work and a formidable weapon.

* For gifts and for the tavern, we end up on a side-quest to fetch 10 x 25gp bottles of wine from Sea Ward, **Devillard's Rare Vintages**!

* We sell acquired silk at Sulmists for 30gp, along with the an amazing haul of gems that we exchange for 6 large trade bars - *6000* gold! - at Carabash's.

* Flush with money, we head to Serpentil's. To help with wisdom against spells? Beacon Of Hope is recommended - so for 250gp, we pick that up as a scroll. For 500gp, we also replace our just-used teleport scroll, too.

* The troll heart - Adren's able to capture its healing powers in an amber amulet, which when worn, provides the wearer with some healing ability.

The visit to Adren is of particular note because we ask about our strange encounter when we felt like something was trying to capture us, or pull us away, after we left the Chapterhouse. Arden's theory is that a **Shadowfell being** may have tried to trap us - an alarming thought; we'd have no way to escape from another plane like that! Our instinct to flee seems justified.

### Day 2

We visit Vajra. She reminds us - given that we'd noticed Yet Another Festival apparently being prepared for across town - that it is, of all things, **New Year's Eve!** We'd completely lost track of such things.

* She confirms a wand can be made. 900gp is paid; it'll be ready the next day.

* **There is to be a council meeting at 5pm** - we must attend.

The day passes with a rather more relaxed time to enjoy Waterdeep and catch up with friends at the tavern. Eventually, the time comes to attend the meeting.

* Vajra is sending Grey to check on the Red Wizards of Thay. Things are afoot there.

* The location of the Blue Mask is being determined by Remalia and the Harpers.

* **Delenn** brings news news of a Green Mask rumoured to be hidden in the Misty Forest.

...so far, so procedural. But then the bombshell.

We are told of **Ylia**, the short name of the human form of **Otaaryliakkarnos** a 1000 year or more old metallic silver dragon. **She is to fly to Dragonmoot, to meet the Five Ancient Metallics in a Dragon Council - and leaves tomorrow, 8am - TAKING US WITH HER.**

This is extraordinary! For creatures so short lived and unimportant as us to have been put forward for such a thing seems overwhelming. We're told it requires two full days of flying, stopping at the Scar Mounts mid-way. We'll arrive on the second day around 8pm.

We leave the council meeting, heads spinning. What an incredible opportunity! We have no idea really what to expect, or what to do. We will have to hope that we can get some help from Ylia once we're resting at the half-way point.

We travel to the main central market. It is busy...

...**Gnog feels a searing pain in his side, looking down to see a blade tearing a huge wound, caught totally off guard! *Assassin*!**

A fierce and difficult battle in close quarters follows, Gnog gravely wounded from the start but powering through with his rage. Our usual grandstand magic tricks are of no use in such a crowded area, with many nearby onlookers cowering behind stalls and fragile trestle tables. This is a poor place for a battle. But then Fee-Ree, in a flash of insight - and apologising to a nearby stall holder - casts an extraordinary spell =that *seems to pull metal objects to her* - a whirlwind of cutlery from a nearby stall and a good many pocket knives from another! It's enough to turn the tide; we make it.

So, we defeat them, but we're beaten up. We reassure onlookers, the City Guard arrive late to the party as usual but fortunately we're now known to them so our story is heard (drawing weapons within the city walls in Waterdeep would normally be a question of "arrest first, ask questions later!") and of course there are plenty of onlookers to verify our tale. We spend time helping clean up the mess from the battle. Garren patches up Gnog enough to keep going and, we figure, we *could* crawl home.

But it's New Year's Eve! We will not be so easily quietened. Celebration! The city hums with music, song, dancing and laughter; from marketplace through the streets to the Goliath Drinks, even in the City Of The Dead, extra driftglobes gathered for light.

Despite the threat of war, despite everything, DR. 1489 ends in celebration and joy.

### Day 3, DR 1490, 8am

We climb Mount Waterdeep, following instructions from the council. Cloud shrouds the dragon sat atop the mount; we climb up, and Ylia takes flight.

Breathtaking. The speed, the rush of air; the sudden ascent, quickly clear of the clouds and a clear view of the city at altitude - surely we can be seen?! - it does not seem to matter; we speed away, the city soon far behind.

Gnog's never seen anything like it. Looking through the eyes of eagles is one thing, but to be here, in person, atop this magnificent being travelling at such speed... Not just Gnog, of course; we are all captivated.

As the hours draw on, we still take in the view and experience; it never seems to become boring. We play games of trying to stand up in the wind - safety magic spells at the ready, just in case! - and talk over events past, present and our thoughts of the future. We are unable to speak to Ylia in her true form of Otaaryliakkarnos, but eventually, after flying over ancient forest with truly giant trees, we reach the Star Mounts. We land in a high cave and there, with a camp fire, we observe the forest stretched out below and finally, get to talking.

Distant lights of an elven forest town - or even perhaps, city - glow amber and yellow, flickering as the leaves dance above them. Ylia and Gnog talk, but it's no heart-to-heart. With her mind apparently very much on the forthcoming council, her age, her power, and her potential are all very apparent; the two speak the same language, but are very different and very far apart. At least some mutual understanding of each other's perspectives is reached.

The next day we fly over lands initially interesting, but turning later to endless sand dunes, in difficult heat even very high above the desert below. The Anauroch, stretched out over a vast distance. As the sun reaches the horizon, we approach strange ruins, near a mountain range that seems to run primarily east-west. There is a plateau of rock, of sorts, with what might once have been some kind of colosseum or other similar forum, plenty crumbled, but plenty still standing. As we come in to land our sense of scale and perspective suddenly shifts - we were further away than we realised; the blockwork is vast, on the scale of giants, yet we're later told this was Netherese, so constructed by human hands and - in its time, a fortress. Ylia lands easily within a kind of circular amphitheater. Less of this fortress, then, remains than we realise! It's a strange conflict of scale and visible construction versus what must be buried in sand, or lost in the tumble of rocks around the plateau edges and on the mountain slopes beyond.

Soon, four more dragons join us. Ancients. We are introduced by what we think are short-form names mostly for our benefit!

* Brass - Ileuthra
* Bronze - Nymmurh
* Copper - Tazmikella
* Gold - Prothanther
* (And of course Silver - Otaaryliakkarnos, or Ylia)

A truly strange debate ensues. Their use of language is strange to us and we find it hard to express ourselves, or to make a connection; but Gnog's time spent talking with Ylia does help somewhat.

The short version is that the short-lived races are transient, warlike, constantly rotate through cycles of destruction; they can be greedy and corrupted easily by magic, something to which the ruins upon which we stand attest.

And *this* is where things get truly intense. Ylia asks for a break, to take us to a high wall and show us something.

We stand there, and from this position see below, far and wide, a *giant* area of heavily destroyed ruins. **The destruction of Thultanthar and Myth Drannor** - giant, flying Netherese cities, ripping each other apart in horrific acts of magical destruction, the weave itself torn asunder; vast nations crashing in pieces to earth, death on an incredible scale... The horror of it. And here, amongst these ruins, the artefacts of the Netherese - by the standards of good-aligned metallics or ourselves, mostly evil. Terribly powerful, artefacts of control, of obedience, of destruction. This location, this place, is remote; once a bountiful green land but a desert now, thanks to the magic that tore this realm apart - and that is fortunate. It keeps people away. Knowledge of these events and this place is kept from us on the Sword Coast; some adventurers might come looking, but the citizens of cities, villages and even the remotes oases in this part of the world will always try to steer them away. **So many objects for which a single one holds too much power for a single person**.

But we have one of those. Ylia turns to Garren, to the shock of the rest of us. His flaming sword. He doesn't remember, but it was gift; a weapon of great power for the time when he needed it. The war before he fell to the crystal curse.

The man of red crystal. Gnog is almost frozen to the spot. It seemed so long ago, but he so easily forgets how Garren had a whole life before that. A family, even - we think.

Now we must prove ourselves. The sword has been used for its purpose and its return is overdue.

For Gnog, this is a deeper emotional wrench than he could possibly have expected. His bonds of friendship to Garren run *deep* and somehow, that sword, held aloft, flames bright, was the very symbol of his purity as a paladin. To Gnog, he'd not realised it, but that sword was always *part* of Garren. And now it must be given back.

And Garren - well Garren doesn't hesitate. Gnog knows him well, and hears the edge to his voice, the disguised slight waver, the emotion he hides leaking out just a fraction... **But he hands over that sword to Ylia and, in that act, perhaps that act alone, gains a trust that will lead to an alliance that saves the world.**

So the council agrees, provided *we* agree - we **promise** - to undertakings.

* The elves must apologise formally for the draconic mythril they use for city protections and, in some high elf cases, even armour. Its origins are of the metallic dragons and they find its use abhorrent.

* The dwarf queen must return her armour from Dragonmoot. This is not frivolous request - it is dragonscale armour, made from **Tazmikella's niece**!

* Humans *must* give up *all* magic items recovered from Tiamat's hoard. Many are believed to be Netherese and there cannot be any risk of any going missing if an attempt was made to sort the objects. Instead, all must be given up. This is their price for aid.

That aid?

* Five dragons will be provided for defence of Sword Coast cities from cult-ordered chromatic attacks.

* Some **sixty-seventy** chromatics in addition will be provided for the "final battle", which they expect to take place at the Well Of Dragons. It will be our own dragon army.

* They will attack too, delayed, as a second wave. And finally - something strange is given to Gnog. It is a flower, crafted out of the air from magic, alighting in his outstretched palm. He is told this is a "flower of persuasion". If he really needs someone to do something, the flower will compel them.

Gnog stores it safely but vocalises his truthful and sincere hope that he is never driven so close to the dark that he uses such a thing. (He does not suspect or think of this as a test, though in hindsight it probably was; he recognises instead the darkness of the times at hand, the enormity of the task ahead and likely cost in lives that we might need to pay even if we succeed - and anything that might help reduce that price should be considered).

Our path is set. We have committed ourselves. We have promised something we must, somehow, deliver. Garren's sword is gone. Gnog has a dark artefact to tempt him. We are no longer free agents.

This is *our* price.

We are flown home over the next two days. A lot of the return trip is spent in silent contemplation. We land on day 6, late. Waterdeep again. It feels different now.

### Day 7 and beyond

Evidence of escalation is everywhere. The city is packed. Beyond its gates, a refugee crisis, especially on the Northern side; tent cities packed together, squalor, lack of aid, lack of water, lack of food; barely contained. We are shown it; we are unable to help. All we can do is try to stem the flow by reducing the damage. When the time comes, we must allocate the 5 dragons for protection with great care and wisdom - somehow.

Garren has no sword. To Gnog, despite his armour, he almost looks naked. Gnog's heart aches for his friend's loss. It's just a sword! But somehow more... Balthor's, then. A frustrating time for the shop assistant and Gnog. No sword seems right. Nothing is as powerful. A Sun Blade comes close; 4800gp; but not quite right, somehow and - anyway - "that's the point", says Garren, "isn't it? That I had to give up something. That would mean nothing if I just purchased something as powerful mere days later."

True enough.

We can, at least, consider our immediate needs. 3500gp, no small price, for **Dragonslayer** - a blade with particular peculiar magical properties that manifest most strongly on such creatures. That's not bad. Garren holds it aloft. Smiles. Looks to Gnog, nods. "This feels right."

A blur of sorts from here. Meetings, council and private. We seem entrusted at a higher level now. We suppose that meeting the ancient Council Of Five might do that! We learn of ways to help keep our promises for apologies and armour:

* King Melandrach - High Forest; be careful! He is a good man, but *not* friendly.
* Ambassador Braunanvil - found at Mithril Hall usually, else check with the relevant Waterdeep embassy to see if they have a more recent location.
* Laeral - at the palace; we will have to try for human accord about magical items at the next council meeting.

We also obtain a list of the names of human lords of the large cities. Funny; they're all human. We'd never noticed the bias, but of course, elves and dwarves are far less numerous. Why does it not seem strange, though, that no gnome, halfling, or indeed golaith (!) sit upon a throne of such a city? Such is the history of the origin and growth of these cities upon the Sword Coast.

Some time later, we are contacted with great urgency by Delaan. Sensing via crows, there has been a discovery which means we must **urgently travel to the Misty Forest** - something is happening there that we have to figure out. **We must leave immediately**.

### Heading for the Misty Forest - day 1

While nowhere near as busy - yet! - as the North gate, the South exit of Waterdeep on the road towards Daggerford and beyond is still a disaster. Once we've spent a *long* time queueing to get out - though not so long as it looks like it'll take to get back *in* - we start travelling south. The road is busy with people mostly headed towards Waterdeep.

We notice two adults and two children. Unlike others that seem laden heavily with belongings as they presumably flee for Waterdeep, these four seem to carry almost nothing but the clothes they wear. They look scared, hungry, thirsty and lost. They're not walking anymore, just off the side of the road, huddled.

Our approach strikes fear in them - Gnog and Fee-Free are certainly intimidating at first glance! - but the shine of Garren's paladin armour helps them relax a little as they see him too. We learn that this is **Corine** and **Beryk**, with their two children. They fled **Morrind Village**, which was raided by cultists; people were taken and the village burned, but they somehow escaped with their lives - though little else. They hoped to find refuge in Daggerford, but it was full! Instead they were forced to continue on the road to Waterdeep, with no preparation for such a journey and charity of passers-by impossible to find on roads now so close to the city and jammed with those who have more than enough problems of their own.

Beryk is a carpenter.

We need a carpenter for proper stables at the Goliath Drinks...

Gnog gets that feeling. When you meet someone by chance and they're just *right*. Like the chance meeting of Charlin and his gang, so long ago. Like the lonely old lady who lived in a crater. Like the wild-eyed girl running around a corner chasing bandits on the main street of Duskhollow. Like the man of red crystal.

Not a difficult decision.

We give them some provisions, a letter to help get them through the Waterdeep gate and the address of the Golaith Drinks, where they should seek Charlin, but any of those who work there will help. We provide a letter of introduction. At a strange flicker of pride, momentarily, in the eyes of Beryk - accustomed doubtless to providing for his family - we insist that this is not charity. He has skills we need - without them, we wouldn't be able to get them so easily through the gates into the crowded city. And while the tavern can provide brief accommodation, in due course they will probably have to find their own, difficult though that well be.

But it's a fighting chance and a much better one than being ignored by passers-by, off to side of the road. They head away.

The first day passes without incident.

### Heading for the Misty Forest - day 2

By the end of the day, by pushing hard, we just make it to Daggerford, late. It's extremely busy - another tent city; difficulty even with our Waterdavian credentials in getting past the main gate guards - this is, after all, its own city and very much not Waterdeep! - but we manage it. Somehow, we end up being told we can stay, of all places, in the main keep! The city is full, the tents beyond are too dangerous and we've certainly been angling hard to try and get some kind of secure accommodation. It is in truth partly selfish, but also defensive; we're a big target for the cultists now and we don't want to draw trouble into the middle of a set of tents full of refugees with no guards and no places to find cover in a fight.

It's quiet and absurdly comfortable. What a strange experience after the chaos of Waterdeep's overcrowded streets and the road beyond.

We try to de-stress; find a tavern. **The Happy Cow** is the unlikely name of a place we choose, with a curious local drink called *Chaluug* on offer. This place is *good*, as is the local beverage. We even buy some samples to take back to our own tavern, always on the look-out for something new and interesting. We have to plan and think in terms of "when this is all over and things are back to normal", since what else are we fighting for?

### Heading for the Misty Forest - day 3

Traffic on the road is lighter. Progress is good. No attacks! A happy day. We make it to Liam's Hold and camp outside (they won't let us in, but well, fair enough...)



## Misty Forest
### Day 1

There's a particular large tree off the road that was described to us. At about 4pm, we recognise it; certainly distinctive. There's a large area of grass, the tree roughly in the middle, with the forest stretched beyond, a wall of tree trunks and bushes.

We approach the tree, wondering what to do next - and then realise we're already surrounded! Wood elves, incredibly stealthy, who must've seen us a long time ago. We talk fast; they are not acting in friendly way at all, very hostile. They do eventually agree, given our stories, name-dropping Delann and our generally persuasive nature (!) to take us into the woods.

"Take us to your leader" isn't uttered but we get more than we hoped for, as we are brought after some time on forest paths to **Alagarthas** - none other than a **son of King Melandrach himself**! He tells us of a half-brother; **Neronvain**, deceased, 1/2 wood elf, 1/2 wild. He was believed killed while trying to gain favour with the great green dragon Chuth - a shortened name, but they don't know the full one - only its transaction: **"He who brings the cloud of death"**. Delann catches up with us.

Chuth has been making numerous incursions into the Misty Forest, destroying villages, killing many elves. The plan largely now is to flee! They're trying to get word out and withdraw. So then, why are we here? Delann believes **news of Neronvain's death might be premature - he may have the green mask and be using it to control Chuth**. Find the dragon, find Neronvain, find the mask. And as a bonus, get embroiled in some very difficult family business between the king and his two brothers!

### Day 2

We head East to Altand Village, escorted by Delann. Along the way, we are attacked! We aren't sure if they are cultists or just bandits, but it is a strong force and a fierce battle. By now, though, it is an unwise foe that battles Gnog's party unprepared.

The journey is long. We are able to use no Fey path shortcuts. We get to Altand late and are introduced straight away to **Warden Gallin**, who talks of the green dragon attacks and the rout of nearby villages. Altand itself was heavily damaged in an attack and many were killed, but they somehow got off comparatively lightly - the village and its people were not totally destroyed.

He is unable to help with the location of the dragon nor the motivation for them.

There's something being held back there. Garren, that evening, communes with Helm; he gleans that there is more to be learned from the details of the recent dragon attack here, and more to be learned from Gallin, but we must tread carefully. We are not trusted here, and we likewise do not know who to trust either.

### Day 3

We talk to various elves about the green dragon attack. Many are reluctant to speak - a combination of trauma and the fact that we're strangers (and not elves, either). We do eventually get a grim picture.

* The dragon had a rider. Pale, green-skinned, humanoid, longbow-wielding.

* The attack here was not complete devastation. They were on the ropes - nearby tree that's a kind of religious sanctuary being used as a last stand by some, the dragon approaching, death by its terrible poisonous breath a certainty - yet then, dragon simply *left*, taking the rider. Nobody knows why.

* Rangers had found a clearing quite close to this village which showed signs of repeated brief visits (squashed down areas of grass, claw marks in earth, a certain degree of a specific kind of poison damage evident to foliage)

* What's more there's a strange path between clearing and village, hard to find, seems like it might be intentionally obscured but had been travelled often enough that once found, was clearly a used path. Strange.  The dragon rider, scoping out the village? Something else? And why reuse a path, rather than take somewhat different forest routes each time, to avoid discovery?

We get some of this from **Kerevan**, head of the forest patrol, but he doesn't have much extra information.

We speak to Gallin again. We had a strange vibe from him the previous day. He was hiding something. We dig deeper. He opens up a bit about his family, as we'd noticed some things around his hut suggesting one. But they're gone - lost in the dragon attack. Sensing that there's more to this, we press him. He starts to haltingly recount a harrowing tale. A wife and son, on a walkway as the attack happened, Gallin a few trees away, the dragon rider jumping between Gallin and them, blocking his path. Running anyway, reckless, to try to get to them, but then stopping short as the dragon rider turned his way. Terrified. Then the dragon sweeping past; wing and claw tearing down the walkway; wife and son falling to their death...

...and that tips him over the edge. Overwhelmed at the emotion, the terrible true story comes out. He lost his nerve at that point. He couldn't save them either way, probably, but the guilt was overwhelming. And once he was on that path, he couldn't stop. *No more deaths here* - so he made an awful, horrible decision. He spoke to the rider that day, and *that* is why the attack was abandoned.

**Gallin is the walker of the path. He meets the dragon and rider in the clearing at 4am. There, he trades information on the location and defensive capabilities of other villages, as his part of the bargain he made on the day of the attack.**

* We try not to let this be widely know. We don't want chaos. Gallin is respected here, and despite his guilt and the inevitable very strong desire now to just have this all in the open, he agrees - for a time.

* He agrees instead at at least partial redemption. There's an outpost that's one of the last not yet attacked. It's not got too many people.

* A courier is sent to reach there as quickly as possible and get them to *immediately* abandon the outpost, tracking back to the village where Alagarthas holds sway - it'll become a staging ground. But the dragon would find it abandoned and be angry so, as a sweetener - at least to buy some time! - as much treasure as this village still has is collected, along with everything we recovered in the battle we fought en route to Altand, to be left behind at the outpost. Our horses find safety by going along - they'll be used to carry all the treasure out, then head back to Alagarthas' village with the evacuating elves.

* Tomorrow (well, technically day-after-tomorrow morning!) at 4am, Gallin will have his 'usual' meeting and, this time, give the location of the now-evacuated outpost. Based on prior experiences, he believes an attack would then happen in the evening of that same day. In the mean time, we'll track Chuth's lair, get prepared therein and wait to launch a surprise attack on the dragon's return.

It's a risky strategy on many fronts but it's the a real chance of getting the jump on the dragon, even given the dangers of a fight within its own lair, and doing so from a place it's less willing to abandon (since we've noticed a certain tendency of dragons to try and flee if they realise that they're actually at risk of death from attack - maybe Chuth will leave it far too late, if unwilling to abandon the lair).

## LEVEL 10 (helped by a big XP bump from solving much of the Misty Forest puzzle, plus the big fight)

### Day 4 - Hunting Chuth

We take all the leads and info we have on flight paths seen for Chuth by ranger elves, along with whatever Gnog can glean from animals, to get a rough direction to travel in the forest. The attacks have been going on for long enough that the elves have a fair idea of the likely lair location already, but it's not pinpointed and rather famously elves tend to delay action until they feel they have *all* the information - not knowing who the rider is, what the rider's skills/strengths are, exactly what defences the lair might have etc. are all reasons to avoid rashly running in to try and attack.

We, of course, are no strangers to rashly running in to just about anywhere.

Progress (survival roles) is mixed. By 8pm, we're still a distance away. Mindful that Gallin will see Chuth overnight and our time is now very short, we have no choice; we must camp.

### Day 5

Early on in the day we hear cries for help. We run to a clearing and see a tree has fallen on someone who appears to be a druid! We are wary. This could be a trap. But we assist in good faith and - short version - this *is* a druid called **Ileura**, with a strong connection to the plants and animals of the forest, who had noticed our travelling this way from some time the previous day. The whole "tree fallen on me" thing was a ruse - the three is in fact a cooperative Treant! Two, in fact, are with her.

Ileura knows *all* about the lair location. Something as noxious as a green dragon can't just land in *her* forest and not get her attention. Trouble is, the lair, as with most green dragons, is protected by a veritable army of creatures under the dragon's sway - they are its eyes and ears. Approach without detection is all but impossible. Close in, giant spiders have built big webs that block the way, *unless* you know it. And that's where druidic magic comes in. We are each handed a flower garland. Each screens the wearer from detection by the various charmed creatures - it's a bit like an exotic and boosted Pass Without A Trace, but only works up to a point. When we're actually at the webs, we'll have to take care to avoid the spiders actually walking up and seeing us directly.

And so it is, with Ileura's help and garlands, that we reach these great webs; we are lucky in stealth and dexterity and cut a path through; and then are able to wait at the base of a small waterfall from a stream that leads into a cave. We find a good hiding place - if the dragon emerges in flight it's *very* unlikely to spot us, especially *inside* its zone of detection and webs - **and in due course at around 5pm we see the dragon fly out; it must have taken Gallin's bait!**

The usual recon shenanigans ensue inside. A left hand passageway seems to lead to some makeshift barracks with - inevitably - a few cultists. Sigh. A right hand passageway leads to a room with - of all things - two Etins! Four heads are better than two... They are arguing. Lots of noise. The twists of the passageway and proximity of its exit into the entrance gallery to the cave mouth mean that noise isn't travelling far out of it. So, we take the risk and get right in there **battling and defeating both etins** without being heard elsewhere.

From this passageway - ignoring the cultists for now - we discover that there's a kind of gallery area above a huge cavern much further back into the cave system. Here, we are astonished to discover elves. They are *extremely* standoffish, bordering on hostile; they've been trapped here, doing slave-like tasks under orders of cultists, unable to leave due to the detection webs and animals and unable to defeat the dragon themselves.

It's a very fraught conversation. We aren't at our most convincing, for sure, but we do well enough that they agree to study one of the garlands we have to see if they can figure out how its magic can shield from detection. There aren't enough garlands for all the elves but they might be able to replicate the effect. They only do this because we also sort-of-convince them that we can defeat Chuth, but they still want to be able to get safely away before any battles start in the cave, and do so *without* the dragon knowing they've gone (since it'd just hunt them down and kill them upon its return, before we ever even got a chance to engage it in battle).

With the elves now no longer feeling they need to do anything other than keep out of the way, we feel free to engage the cultists on the other side of the cavern. It's a pretty easy battle; their numbers aren't too great and they don't seem to have any particularly special skills. We definitely have another one of those rather serious moral twinges at this - they'd kill us if they could, but they're young, inexperienced and misguided; but there's just no *talking* to them. All we can do is fight.

Back at the elves, the first garland is understood but destroyed in the process. They could use another and amplify its effects...? Well, we figure we might need one or two ourselves in case of emergencies if the battle goes badly but otherwise, we've already lost one, so losing another isn't the end of the world - we give them a second garland. It seems we have won their full trust and they reveal to our astonishment that the **dragon rider is none other than the king's other son, Neronvain** - rumours of his death were greatly exaggerated.

We have no idea how we'll ever explain or prove *that* to King Melandrach or Prince Alagarthas. Yikes.

They depart with haste (and very elven stealth; we're confident they'll make it out - we certainly hope so, as their escape if detected would alert Chuth that things are not well in the lair and our element of surprise will be largely gone).

It seems that, possible traps aside - Deni on high alert - there is nobody else left. We are able to explore. The main lair chamber is accessed either via a pool and very pond-weed-filled large under water tunnel, or a small side access way found via the cultist barracks. The first is for dragons, we think, the other for people. We're fortunate to find the other first, else we might've been tempted to try the underwater swim - but that pond weed looks like it might well be able to grab hold of an unwary passer-by, and we don't know what other aquatic life might be in there that may have a way to warn the dragon of intruders.

Another rather more important thing found off the barrack's Neronvain's room. It transpires that proving his involvement to the King won't be so difficult - **we find his journal**. Even just skimming through, is very difficult reading; a path of increasing bitterness that brought him onto a path descending to madness. At the core, a very bad case of sibling rivalry and assumed favouritism by the King.

Continuing, we find a narrow tunnel that curves around where we think the pool chamber is, eventually coming out on the floor of a great cavern, with another pool to our right as we enter. **The lair**. The pools must indeed connect and we are now pretty sure that the dragon uses that route to enter this chamber.

We start to discuss strategy. It's hard to imagine fighting anywhere else, but to fight a dragon in its lair is about as dangerous a choice as one could make! We'll have Neronvain to contend with too. Deni, to help us out, decides to go back to the exit chamber so she can keep watch for the dragon's arrival back. We figure it can't be too long until that happens. Then, only a short time later, we hear Deni hollering as she *races* at tremendous speed down the access tunnel. "It's here! He's chasing me!" - it seems the dragon arrived, she was spotted straight away (darned Truesight!) and Neronvain jumped off, in pursuit.

Battle commences. We manage to get some surprise on the dragon at first because it knew about Deni, but not about the three of us. There's a rapid change of plan, though, from what we'd wanted because the dragon bursts through the pool up high straight away - so Fee-Ree gets Gnog and Garren into the air with Fly, and we soon start attacking from above and below, flanking vertically. Garren's aura prevents any fear and we manage to get a quick head start, with some good hits, weakening the dragon by a surprising amount.

Neronvain enters and tries a poison cloud effect, but Fee-Ree manages to counter the worst of it. He barely has time to act before the dragon, weakened and worried, chooses self-preservation over Neronvain and starts to try and lee. Opportunity attacks find their mark from Gnog and Garren and then, Deni, who has finally got to a good position for one her dragon-killing arrows, fires.

*Crit!* The dragon killing arrow lives up to its name! The foul beast crashes down.

Neronvain is both outraged and sorrowful but neither his rage or sorrow can defeat the four of us, even after battling a dragon. He is captured alive.

Grisly a task it might be, but we can't ignore the value of the green dragon and set about attempting to harvest things that might help us in our future fights. We manage to get a good number of large scales, its horn - that was a big undertaking! - and some bone. Finally, at around 10pm, we've re-checked all caverns. This place is done. The nightmare here is over. We get to the river nearby - no problems with giant spiders on the way, fortunately - unpack the portable folding boat and make our way downstream.

### Day 6 (1am)

About three hours later, we figure we're at the exit point to continue on foot for Altand. It's very late and we're getting exhausted but decide to push on. We are greatly concerned about the fate of the outpost during our ruse - did Chuth all for it? The dragon did return a bit earlier than expected, but at least some of the plan must surely have worked as we did still have a of time in the caverns before the dragon's appearance. Finally, to our relief, we see the track opening up to the clearing outside Altand...

...and there, we grieve; for here lies the body of Gallin. The dragon saw through the ruse. Perhaps it always would have. Perhaps Gallin knew.

Back at the outpost, we don't really bring people up to speed; we just set up camp and fall into a dreamless sleep.

### Day 6 (9am)

On insight, we check Gallin's room, to see if there's anything he left. There's a note. It's as we feared - he never thought the dragon would fall for the plan. Instead, he sacrificed himself; the only way he could atone, and the only way he thought the plan would work.

We resolve to never reveal the truth to anyone. Not even the royal family. Instead, a funeral is arranged. Whatever mistakes he made, he laid down his life to make up for it. **Gallin is with his family now.**

Tearful departures, some time later; we travel for Alagarthas' outpost.

### Day 6 (5pm)

It's been a difficult journey - we have, after all, been dragging around an unwilling captured Neronvain the whole time! He is certainly *not* of even remotely sound mind. It is therefore with very mixed emotions that we at long last reach the outpost and Alagarthas is reunited, after a fashion, with his brother. He will remain there while the elves try to figure out what to do. We hand over the journal, of course, warning that it is very grim reading but nonetheless provides valuable insights.

We can't stay. The spectre of war looms large. Pointed in the direction of a fey path to help speed our way, we are lucky enough to find ourselves outside Daggerford just a few hours later. It's chaos - a huge refugee camp is set up outside, tents sprawling in uncoordinated positions, queues for Daggerford workers trying to provide food and water aid; we are viewed, in all our finest travelling clothe and with all our bristling weaponry, with understandable distrust as we pass through! At the gate, we manage to, as previously, blag our way in and are tremendously lucky in finding a small, but workable room in an inn.

### Day 6 (around 9-10pm)

We've had food and returned to our room, just about to sleep, when commotion is heard. We rush outside. Orange light flares beyond the gate. At best speed, we dash to the gates - now wide open, soldiers spilling outwards - to see horror; **cultists are attacking - and have a young red dragon, its fire breath decimating the refugee tents, blazes everywhere, who knows how many dead already**.

We rush into battle. It is long and difficult - most of those we fight don't seem all that strong or especially powerful (with one or two exceptions) but it's more just about sheer numbers and, of course, the dragon - we really want to focus on it but it's very mobile and we're constantly distracted by battles on the ground. In the end, it is defeated, but the cost is great. With whatever remaining magic or physical items we have left available to us, we try to put out fires, administer medical aid and so forth, but there's no escaping the fact that a lot of damage was done. We can't be too maudlin about this - the city guards were outstanding in battle, but without our additional magic, ranged abilities and the various other weapons we have been so fortunate to gain over the last few weeks, it would have been much worse.



## Waterdeep
### Day 7-10 

It's a long 3 days to Waterdeep; this time, we're going *with* the bulk of the traffic, so it's slower going than when we left. It takes a while to get through the refugee camp, but we have all the right paperwork; soon, we're in the now-packed city, arriving late afternoon. We say hi at the Golaith Drinks but we'll soon be trading and figuring out how to best use our new gear, make new weapons, sell old and so-on.

It turns out that Balthor's has "deep pockets" - as we unpack the bag of holding, it's surprising to see so much acquired.

* Wings from the young red - 3200gp
* Some scales too - 1600gp
* Its horn - 650gp
* Scales and leather from Chuth - 3600gp
* Chuth's horn - 1600gp

We also pay for things to be made.

* Two big bones from Chuth - can be turned into a poisoning greatsword, gem sockets, Adamantium bindings; it'll be very, very formidable - 1600gp
* Four small bones - can be turned into 6 crossbow bolts (300gp) and a shortsword (750gp)

On other objects, our longbow + 1, impressive as it is, comes in at just 150gp if we sold it. Puts the other new weaponry into perspective, for sure. The Bracers Of Defence are much more valuable - a whopping 5000gp if we sold - and as for the Lightning armour, 2400gp if sold; we compare that with the cost of enchanting the older armour - to +1, 1200gp; to +2, 5000gp, +3, 40000gp (!) - and of course there's a considerable extra time factor involved in each jump of enchantment strength; we go for +2 as a balance.

In the end, our total sale amount comes to some 15450gp, while we're purchasing 7560gp plus spme healing potions (950, 500gp) and *two* Quivers Of Elhonna (600gp x 2). After some bargaining, we have a net gain of 6695gp *and* of course we have all the things we've purchased or contracted.

It's mind-blowing how things have escalated. Once upon a time, not long ago, 1gp felt like a lot. And we're not even done yet! We get to Karabash's Figures Of Wonder and net a further 2000gp from our various collected art objects.

Deni walks with a spring in her step the likes of which Gnog's never seen - and yet, it's happiness, not arrogance. Somehow, she remains grounded. Gnog will never cease to be impressed by her. He's certainly not sure if he is managing to maintain such a level head himself, in the face of such power and wealth.

Then we are back to business. All manner of names and visits and people, due to the expanding network of people and organisations trying to discover as much as possible about the dragon cult:

* Blackstaff Vajra
* **Lady Dala** and **Leirol Silverhand**
* Rumours of devils seen near Baldur's Gate; contact Onthar Frume there
* **Remalia is missing** - check in with Sarqarim for more on that

It's taken us to northernmost edges of the city. With all this buzzing around in our minds we head back towards the tavern on foot, and take an opportunity to drop in at the Harper's Chapter House. There we find many familiar faces - Sarqarim, Leosin and Carlin. There are new faces too:

* **Meoresta**, a female Tabaxi who was investigating far down South
* **Diollan** (male human) and Bersanda (female halfling) investigating great wizards in the far East
* Gnome brothers **Toowin** and **Tovin**, who have been following up a Blue Mask lead that points to Candlekeep

Even more information, then. And following those discussions we are instructed to meet with a contact of the Black Network, via the Yawning Portal, that evening. There are rumours that Remalia's son **Llewelyn** and the Green Mask are somehow linked; we are fearing for her safety now... An information exchange is offered - we are to be in Dock Ward tomorrow evening.

A busy day ends...

...and another buys day starts. We collect the red leather from Balthar's and spend 1000gp on paperwork! Charlin's Chaps attain formal 50% ownership of the tavern - but he in return gives us 180gp back straight away, as our arising share from unexpectedly high profits in the first 3 months.

Since we have other business in the Dock Ward besides the information exchange, we head there. The leather is dropped off at a tanners, and will later be sewn at Sulmist's. We've heard that Sehanine's Bow docked last night and catch up with some of the crew, over at pier 32. Through them we learn of a growing refugee community *beneath* the streets; a growing, hidden problem. We take a look and it's grim, so elect to change our plans until this evening and rather than staying down in the Dock Ward, go to catch up with Lady Dala in the North Ward to discuss options for how this refugee crisis might be tackled. We're not sure if she knows about the under-city developments but she, of course, certainly is - and what's more, takes us up onto the walls at the North Gate. Beyond, stretching a _long_ way, is a new tent city... The problem is far worse than we realised, and continues to grow. Lady Dala has things in hand as best she can; for our part, it's best we focus on the cult. She knows that if there's anything we can do to help, all she has to do is ask.

We run into Saqarim again on our way back through town; he's been looking for us. Thought we were in the Dock Ward - well, found us eventually! He is chasing a clue to Remalia, which leads him towards Red Larch of all places and he'd like our help. He's going tonight, but we have urgent business here first. He agrees to wait as long as he can.

With that, we return to the Dock Ward and, in due course, our meeting is upon us. The Black Network is, it transpires, the Zhentarim - we aren't too surprised, but certainly very much on guard, dealing with such a notorious and extensive criminal network. But we have a shared enemy and there is the opportunity for some kind of truce or a shaky alliance, albeit one with very minimal trust. That said, we are surprised when familiar faces arrive - gnome **Jamna Gleamsilver**, from our caravan days, who has somehow ended up embroiled in this particular facet of proceedings! With her are **Pebo** (older human male) and **Rebba** (perhaps a half-elf, age hard to guess) and between us we do manage to trust _just enough_ to share useful information.

* Green mask *was* sold to Remalia's brother Llewelyn.
* He was *murdered* by cultists in the Desarin Valley, only about 1 day out from Red Larch!
* This happened 5 days ago and it's believed Remalia rushed there; she is with his... Body.
* The cult took the green mask. It was whisked away by a rider on a dragon, no less.
* As for the *white* mask - well, the Black Network killed its previous owner, apparently.
* The red mask *is* with Severin as suspected.
* The blue mask is confusing; there are two leads for two locations, which makes little sense.
* Several cult groups are being summed from the outer reaches towards the Well on foot - the majority are expected to reach there in around **40 days**.

We're shown paperwork, redacted in places, which was recovered from a raid. This indicates some last known locations and directions of several of the travelling cult groups, which are transporting prisoners (we're not sure why). Sabotage could be arranged to slow them down, and/or release prisoners; but there are serious resource constraints for our various forces, spread out so far with so many different avenues of investigation. The Zhentarim agree that they could target three different groups, but there will be a price. And they won't reveal it.

We have to make a call - and whether or not we're really authorised to say so, we agree to the idea of the prisoner rescue effort. We'll figure out how to pay later (!). Bad feeling about that, but we can't just let this opportunity to interfere with cult operations at a larger level slip by and timing is critical. The information on the paperwork is new enough to have an idea of where to intercept some of these groups, but only just. It'll get out of date quickly. It's a big continent to search for people who are trying to keep hidden and especially with many of them travelling off-road!

Sarqarim ultimately decides to head to Red Larch alone, based on the updated information. We aren't needed there. And indeed, we're not immediately needed *anywhere*, which is kind of jarring - from all the running around and being "in the thick of it" we find ourselves attempting to have some kind of downtime.



### Day 11 (morning)

So there we are, on our first day off, not knowing what to do with it - and a Sending message is received by Gnog from, of all people, the giant Blagothkus! There's a cryptic description of a location; we didn't think magic messages could be interrupted but he seems paranoid. And it's urgent. The region described is off the coast so we seek out Ophithana and her navigator. She thinks our destination would be a group of islands known as the Whale Bones and her curiosity is such that she offers immediately to take us there on Sehanine's Bow - and we can leave immediately.



## Sehanine's Bow
### Day 11 (evening) to 14

We set sail in the evening, since the ship needed to be stocked for the voyage and crew recalled to duty. It takes three nights then, early on the morning after that third night, we see the islands. Low cloud shrouds parts of the stark rock rising up; thin islands, steep sided, easy to see where the "Whale Bones" name came from. A daytime new moon hangs low above in an otherwise clear sky. Ophithana opines that the cloudy weather low dow like this is rather odd, which puts us on edge, but we know that Skyreach uses mist and cloud to hide itself.

The ship navigates in slowly and soon we can see a very much thicker cloud towards the centre of the cluster of small islands, which seems curiously immobile regardless of the sea breeze; it's abutting one particular island and we're now very sure that Skyreach is above. We get out onto a thin, rocky shore and start to plan our climb up. It's perilous and the four of us each have moments where we might fall, but for skills, magic or in one case just use of ropes helps! Up-top, it's a rock plateau. A cloud towers above us. From this angle, there is familiarity and we walk confidently across and into the mists, but take care not to walk straight off the edge of the plateau! On the far side, we can see through the mist to the castle itself, call across to the guards and the doors are opened. The massive drawbridge swings down and within moments we are reunited with Blagothkus.

There is much he needs to tell us! The giants have been very busy.

They have observed the Well of Dragons. The land around has been swept clean of life. There are many mercenary armies - may flags fly. Their numbers include various devils. The castle witnessed some 31 tribes of giants marching South, presumably to join them; some 1000-2000 estimated in total. And if that were not bad enough, they estimate no less than **around one hundred dragons** around the volcano!

Grim news indeed.

Balgothkus has formed a small tribe of his own, some 40 or so, known as "The Leavers". It is very unusual in giant culture, since it is a true mixture - many different giant kinds, ages and social classes. Balgothkus sees ruin in the fragmentation of tribes and their march to war at the Well; he wants a different future.

- We have an alliance
- Some giants will infiltrate the marching tribes to sow dissent
- Others will hold here, with the castle staying hidden, reaching out to try and grow their numbers

Communication will be via eagles! They will land at a forest beyond Snowbeadle's, East of Waterdeep.

(On our way out, we end up finding an old keep and there is an unexpected battle with harpies and a kruthik hive!)

A sombre sail back to Waterdeep, filling in Ophithana and crew. But at least we have giants on-side, and we have high hopes for persuasiveness of the infiltrators of the marching giants.

* Sehanine's Bow is drafted into new service as a refugee transport - at Ophithana's suggestion, feeling they can no longer metaphorically stand on the sidelines. They will work with relief agencies in Waterdeep.



## Waterdeep
### Day 14

There is the Usual Shopping Episode - we collect a few things from Balthors and we drop off the Kruthik carapace; at Karabash's, we sell off art found back at the Keep, but keep one important piece of a local museum.

During a heart-to-heart in the group, a remark reminds us of the pressure and importance - we *think* - of what we are doing: **"You just have to keep going, and hope that you don't put a foot wrong!"**

### Day 15

Sulmist's has finished Deni's red dragon armour; at Balthor's, Garren upgrades to +2 armour, complete with storage chest and stand. We are really passing time until midday, at which time there is the 3rd "secret" council eeting. Daggult arrives with Rhian Nightshade, a female purple tiefling; and the meeting begins:

* Harpers
  - The Draakhorn is on the North-East side of a specific volcano central to the Well Of Dragons
  - A cavern and lava tube map is available thanks to McCath of the Arcane Brotherhood
  - There are signs of fractures within the Cult - not all agree with Severin and some "old-school cultists" may help us in a rebellion.

* Sir Isteval
  - 8,000 of Cormyr's purple dragon knights are mobilised to our cause!
  - There may be access to the College of War Wizards too.

* Remalia and Vajra
  - There is a 1-time offer to ally with Red Wizards; an envoy must be sent, to try and convince them. Sastan himself sent the invitation. A Red Wizard called **Nyhilicch** carried the message, is nearby and can teleport people there.

We recognise the danger and moral issues but *must* surely meet with the Red Wizards. Ignoring their power would be foolish and if they were to instead side with the cultists it would be disastrous. There is a particular farmhouse a distance beyond the city walls where Nyhilicch hides - **we are to meet them there in 2 days.**

Further, there is urgency on a lead with **Iskander** at Xonthal's tower on the Blue Mask. That's about 1.5 days from a lodge at a teleport exit in Nesmé; if we can teleport with horses, it would certainly speed things up. The horses might not be too happy about it!

Towards the meeting close, there is a mention of a possible deal with Azmodeus. It's too early to make a call on that one and, frankly, we're relieved. Dealing with the Red Wizards is bad enough. Going to Azmodeus, of all creatures, is a much more extreme swing towards the dark and carries considerably greater chances of being tricked/misled one way or another.

With our path set, Thunderspells gives us two stones - they power specific teleports. One-shot.

We will need more information - going into anything blind is unwise. The group discusses.

* Lord Arenal's private library in Sea Ward is rumoured to have more information than common - possibly, more than is strictly legal to hold! - about the Red Wizards.
* Arcane History books elsewhere should shed some light on Xonthal's Tower. Serpentil has some information on a maze that surrounds the tower. Apparently it's transdimensional... It will require lateral thinking; it is not so simple as something through which one simply traces their steps and keeps trying until all paths are covered. Apparently there's some sort of sundial trick there, where ball bearings and chalk can help figure out the puzzle.

We stop by with Adren, full of questions about options for this "transdimensional" maze. He's his usual curious self... He can't really help. But curiously, he has a recommendation for an alchemist, if we have need - gnome Hugo Tarantale, real name Mieliki, in the South Ward. It's a strange thing to mention and we figure there's some deeper secret here, but for now we press on to Sea Ward to meet Lord Arenal and request library access.

When we get there, something is wrong. No guards at the gate... **We discover them hidden, murdered!** We sneak inside and find poorly-concealed footprints that lead to a trellis. We climb quietly up. A broken window; a way in; and...

...**battle!** We are set upon by cult forces, including a vampire. It's fierce. A red wizard joins in from another room early on - and it's no other than **Rath Modar** themselves. We prevail, even managing to take down Rath thanks to new abilities of Garren when in close combat with wizards. Both he and our party have been learning from previous encounters, but we haven't learned quite enough. As Fee-Ree goes to check on him and notices a curious necklace, it activates - some kind of escape spell for if he falls unconscious. He is teleported away. Rats!

Fortunately Arenal was not killed. We learn what we can. Apart from using library knowledge ourselves, it seems the cult probably wanted *personal* knowledge and power arising from some of the - uuuh - aforementioned "less legal" parts of his collection. They are undeniably ruthless and evil but now there's no doubt; there is a fracture in the ranks of the Red Wizards. Rath is not aligned with Sastan. It seems unthinkable still, but we really do find ourselves now *seriously* entertaining Sastan's offer of an alliance as legitimate. We find ourselves much less sceptical.

It's late when we're back at the tavern; about 9:30pm. Just as we are trying to relax, around 10pm, **the tavern itself is attacked**. Terrified patrons are ushered down into the cellar by Fee-Ree and Deni as Gnog and Garren try to keep attacking forces occupied. There are the usual minions, callously used almost as cannon fodder just to keep us distracted, but we know enough by now to keep our eye out for the Big Bads and - yes, there they are. Two devils form part of this attacking party. An inspired and successful use of Banishment by Fee Ree is enough for us to prevail; we keep her protected from harm until its effects have become permanent and, so, win the day - sort of. The devils aren't dead, of course; and this attack does rattle us and everyone else who was here, which surely accomplishes some of what the cultists had in mind.

It's an uneasy night of half-sleep for us all.

### Day 16

It's study day! We must learn all we can about Thay.

* Tharcion: A title; a governor of sorts
* Red Wizards: Specialise in particular schools of magic, but bad at other things
* Zulkir: A title; head of a school
* Sastam: The Zulkir of Necromancy; rose to power during the Spell Plague

Why this split in the ranks? A possible root of this could be the so-called **Thayan Resurrection**, which takes Thay from its current focus on necromancy and returns it, instead, to conquering.

Etiquette!

* Deference
* Always use a deferential title unless someone is below us; then use denigration!
* They'll use the right words; we just try to copy that
* We must not recoil from undead - or from destroying things, injuring or stealing (!) - nor should we recoil from slaves (this just gets worse and worse)

We have been given extra writs to show we are who we say and to try and assert some kind of diplomatic protection, but nobody is pretending this is at all safe.
