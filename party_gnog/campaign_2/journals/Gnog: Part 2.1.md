# Gnog: Part 2.1
## NESMAY (NESMÉ) and even more with Gnog's axe)

Campaign 1 ended with our departure from the airborne castle **Skyreach**, having slain the white dragon **Glazhael** and ultimately befriended - after a fashion - cloud giant and king **Blagothkus**. We were set down a distance from Nesmay and were last seen walking through rolling fields of long grass on our way back there.

It takes a while to walk into Nesmé. We're not in a rush. It's a beautiful place on a beautiful day and our recent experiences give us much to discuss and take in. When we do arrive, we take time to walk the streets a while, re-familiarising ourselves with the streets, discovering new alleyways and readjusting to the clatter and bustle of this growing, rebuilding little city. By about 6:30pm it's already gone dark and we head to the Black Antlers, getting a room. After having some food we decide it might be nice to wander Nesmay's streets once more, this time, after dark. We get to the road with the smithy; warm light spills out from an open door, sounds of work from within.

We go in and get chatting with Braenor and Dwendalyn. On the subject of Waterdeep, they mention they have cousins there. The subject of Gnog's old axe comes up. It has indeed had work done, but there is a missing component - **Gnog's Dragon Slayer amulet**. With permission, they take it and get to work. Gnog’s ancestral greataxe is combined with his newer, magical greataxe, now mithril-etched by being imbued with the Dwarven talisman of the Giant Slayer. It has an extra-long haft and the two axe heads are interlocked, forming a double-headed axe with continuous Dwarven runes etched in mithril and a collar of mithril with the words Giant Slayer written in Dwarven.

**It is glorious** - a spectacular piece of work.

Later, through conversations at the Black Antler, Sarqarim tells us that he is headed home - a journey South of several months. It transpires to be a somewhat melancholy story - he is anxious, as he had a partner there whom he had to leave in pursuit of duty. He does not know if she has kept waiting all this time; already over two months, but with a slower, rather less magical journey home, a longer wait still. He thinks he might resume his career as a diplomat there. We are sorry to see him go - he was someone we had grown to trust and like very quickly, with our shared adversity forging a deep bond.

He departs in the morning. We sincerely wish him the very best and hope our paths cross again. It is our time, too, to leave. We leave a message about our exploits with the Harpers, thank them for their support and hospitality and head out, intending to travel back the way we had originally come, a long journey to Duskhollow ahead. Heading West out of the town, we use the river barge to cross the Subrin River. On the verge of continuing along the road West, a prickling-of-hairs on the back of Gnog's neck and a strange feeling of confidence causes him to persuade the party to follow him a different way, which takes us cross-country in more of a North-West direction.

By rights, we start from around 50 miles out of the nearest border of the Lurkwood and many more miles beyond that to Duskhollow. Gnog is confident all the same. After around 7 hours of travel with only a short stop for lunch, we reach a river crossing. This causes confusion; the river should have been well beyond our reach, even if we had ridden horses at best speed and we wonder if it isn't the river that our maps indicate. It is wide but shallow at the point of our approach and easily forded. After some searching, Gnog picks up the path on the far side. Things become quite strange; one looks away briefly from the distant Lurkwood trees to some other piece of scenery, then glance back to see it suddenly closer. The effect magnifies and to our astonishment, we reach the boundary. Gnog looks at the party, his eyes shining; "Fey!" he says, and we walk inside. Gnog's pace quickens with excitement and we push on, the path unfamiliar and twisting, but the woods around bearing hallmarks that are indeed of Fey nature, at least from what we say on Fey paths trodden before - colours that are too bright and a tendency in shadows to see rather more luminescent fungi than would seem typical for a normal forest.

We're getting tired; 8.5 hours of travel, with Gnog's quicker pace hard to track - but then we burst out into a clearing.

We walked from Nesmé to Duskhollow in just one day. **HOME**. It's a briefly overwhelming feeling.



## DUSKHOLLOW

Gnog confesses he doesn't know where the Fey path notion comes from, but is aware that he will be able to find it again - though he thinks it'll work only *from* Nesmay, not to it. We head to Eliastra's hut and look inside - she's preparing food... "Ah, yes, I thought you were coming!" - remarkable. She perhaps somehow had provided an at-distance helping hand in our choice of route. We sit and chat, the strange experiences and time apart washing away with our words, the food and the drink.

Over the next couple of days, we're able to deliver the gifts we'd been carrying. Some surplus items are traded in town and there's a general catch up. (Lots of RP; plenty of news about people coming and going, the state of town and continued tales of the strange weather to the North).

We learn that Destin had an old cottage which, now that he resides within the druidic circle working on controlling his Lycanthropy condition, has fallen into disrepair - besides, we're told, there's always room with his father Adwyn at the temple. **We are offered the cottage as a place to say of our own.**

Over the next few weeks, we fix up the cottage and become a recognised and regular part of the Duskhollow village community, rather than sitting on its fringes as we had before. Deni is able to visit her aunt make sure she's OK. Our rapid (if unintentional) financial gains from adventuring are able to give Deni greater confidence that she'll be OK. We help with some farm maintenance too.

One day, a raven flies up to Gnog. Around its leg is tied a small scrap of parchment inscribed with a circle of strange rune-like symbols and the word 'Waterdeep' in common. We have an inkling that they might be related to teleport circles, since there's a feeling of familiarity, if not necessarily a visual similarity, to the circle we saw at Nearytar and those that it in turn led to, outside the hunting lodge. Janvair confirms our suspicions. Waterdeep! Well, then, it seems we might make it down there after all.

Eliastra and Gnog have grown closer. Given our imminent departure into, doubtless, some kind of danger, she remarks that their fates are intertwined somewhat. There is a connection and he might be able to draw upon it in a time of need (mechanics: extra 1d4 on a chosen critical ability/savings throw, "consumed" if the throw succeeds but not if it should still fail).

It takes a day for Janvair to figure out the teleport. The departure is understandably emotional. The teleport itself is quite something. As the spell is cast, branches as if from a tree or bush spring up out of the ground and start to grow, forming eventually a large circle with leaves and flowers sprouting all over. It's very beautiful. The centre is then filled with at first a kind of shifting, distorted mirror in which we see ourselves all standing and watching but then, with a soft 'pop', it disappears and we see a stone room; there is no visual discontinuity of any kind; it's like looking at a regular, everyday, open door. Janvair hurries us through - we step across and, unlike other teleports we've experienced, the sensation of travel is just like we see - stepping through a door; nothing unusual at all. We turn. Gnog is holding back tears, as he fears for whether his little group might see their friends again, or what the future might hold for any of them. Our druid friends stand beyond, and we wave; at that moment, the portal blinks closed and we are suddenly simply staring at a brick wall.



## WATERDEEP (late May 2021 real-world time)
### The chapter house

We turn to look at the room; an unassuming rectangular stone block wall and flagstone room, a teleportation circle drawn beneath our feet at one end, and looking down the longer length of the room to the other, a door at the far end but on the right-hand wall. It suddenly is flung open and people dash in, including armed guards! It seems that arrivals are usually somehow announced or scheduled, but we are able to show them the parchment, mention the raven and Harpers, and at this, we're granted entry to the rest of the building.

Upon leaving the small room we're greeted by an enthusiastic Leosin, who had sent for us via the raven. He was sure we'd able to figure out how to use the information. He leads us along a corridor to a stretch that runs within the building's footprint, but like a kind of long balcony, doors at either end and open rather than walled at the long edge, with just a railing. Beyond rises what we're told is Mt Waterdeep; it's blue sky, very warm (uncomfortable, a little, for Gnog in fact) and spectacular - griffons circle above. They are apparently part of the city guard.



### Early exploration

From here, things are a bit of a blur. It obviously takes our party a while to learn about Waterdeep. We're given a written brief guide to some of the rules and customs along with a street map, and told that we're in fact the Harpers Chapter House, on the Western edge of a district called Castle Ward (in-game: It's a place that, intentionally from the outside, looks nothing special; a little South the intersection of Selduth Street and the Street Of Skills in terms of North-South location, but one street further West of the Street of Skills - Sword Street - and on the Western side of that street, so that it backs onto Mt Waterdeep rather than any other North-South roads). We amass quite the To Do list.

* There's a significant temple to Helm in the Southern Ward that Garren is keen to visit.
* Deni considers a magic bow.
* Can we find ourselves a Bag Of Holding here? We are advised that the Calorshites of the Southern Ward have many wonders, perhaps including such an item, which might be found for a more approachable price than Waterdeep's more well known and mainstream magic item retailers.
* (We do in due course investigate Southern Ward, a fascinating place and Fee-Ree does indeed acquire a well-priced, unusually styled Bag Of Holding, which will be extremely useful for our overloaded party of hoarders!)
* The famous "Yawning Portal" tavern, run by **Durnan**, sounds like a tourist trap but it contains a direct entrance to the sub-city Underdark and that must surely be worth a look.
* We need horses!
* And last, but very much not least - **we need to find Charlin**.



### Finding Charlin

At one point, we turn a corner having made our way - through the crazy, almost claustrophobic, busy crowds on the main streets to which we initially constrain ourselves for sake of not getting lost - to an elevated position; when we turn a corner, Gnog - by virtue of his stature - gets an unexpected line of sight view over the heads of the crowd directly down to the harbour. **Gnog's breath catches in an unintentional gasp at the sight of the sea glistening in the sun. For all his army travels after he left his tribe, they were never on the coast. This is his first glimpse of the sea. Even though the view from here is limited, it truly is as big and awe-inspiring as people had told him.**

We end up at a giant, central market, with a very busy encircling road that has some kind of rotation direction traffic convention that takes some getting used to. We manage to cross without being trampled! Within, the market is predictably busy. Rather than feeling claustrophobic, though, the atmosphere here is more alluring - more exciting perhaps. It's familiar; traders, food, weapons, trinkets, cloth... *Everything* seems present. Many people move more slowly and in a more random pattern compared to the throngs moving with purpose and at speed on the main streets, which makes it easier to just let ourselves drift with the crowd and see what is on offer here.

So it is, presently, that we find ourselves over on the Eastern edge. There is some dispute near a collection of colourful but beaten-up caravans and two City Guardsmen, which we overhear is related to the caravans (and their horses, tucked away in a corner) having set up in the market area for too long - they need to move on. Concessions are given and a small sum of money changes hands, which seems an above-board payment for what amounts to stall rental space, but it seems that this might be the last money that they have, or close to it.

Admittedly, we're eavesdropping, but in part only because the crowd has pushed us here. We've ended up towards the back of the caravans, next to the horses. Gnog is surprised when one nuzzles his ear. He moves away a little, but the horse pushes back; it's affectionate, not angry. Gnog turns to look and - impossibly - **it's his horse** - or rather, the one he gave to Charlin. Gnog gasps in surprise and tells the others. **Is Charlin here? Have we such luck?**

Hurriedly we push our way into the caravan circle. People are sat around on plain wooden benches - planks on crates - in a rough circle and there, amongst them, is against all reason Charlin himself. Gnog is moved to tears and chokes out a shout of his name before running in and embracing his friend. "You - you *waited*. You waited for us. After all this time..." - we can scarcely believe it. This man's heart and honour are larger than all of us.

There is much catching up. We arrive in the nick of time. The money is almost gone. Charlin, as is his wont, has tried various ventures but they haven't all gone to plan. In particular, there's a guild system at Waterdeep but it involves paying fees for registration and so-forth, so in a recent deal Charlin tried to fly under that radar but was scammed. He lost a lot. His band of Chaps have stood with him through it all, and the travellers with whom they are now staying are banded together, making the best of it, but "running on fumes" now. We are able to help, but take care not to just hand out charity - these people are proud and, given their resilience, so they should be.

Eventually, we are able to improve the situation just through strength in numbers and being able to ostensibly pay our way for Charlin's stewardship of the horses and Golaith Drinks wagon. Only Gnog's horse is at the market - we have been told by the Harpers on arrival to Waterdeep that the others were being looked after by a Harper at #42 Back Of The Lane, near Irimar's Walk / Lamp Street in Trade Ward. We have been given a note to help us retrieve them.

Charlin has become quite animated and excited; he had seemed almost - but not quite - beaten as they'd handed over their last few coins for one more day in the market circle, but our arrival brings back his enthusiasm and now-familiar scheming with a hundred different money-making and ideas firing off in his head. Front of mind, it seems, is a possible hospitality play; there is a building he thinks could become a good tavern, "needs a bit of work", but the rental is good for what and where it is. Perhaps we'd go into business with him, if we floated enough to get the rent started so he could start to build an income? It's on the South Side of Winter Path, near something called the City Of The Dead (thankfully, our Waterdeep paperwork from the Harpers contains a decent map and these various unfamiliar addresses are easy enough to find).

It's 750gp for the rent - we're not sure of the period because we have to avoid showing our surprise at the high figure - but Charlin's enthusiasm is too great for us to quash. He has to run off and organise a meeting with the property agent. He will reconvene with us at the "Court Of The White Bull", in the tavern curiously called "White Bull Returned", at a later time.



### The Tavern

We take in the city sights until the meeting is due. We catch up with Charlin and the property agent. We detect a certain bluster in the agent's enthusiastic sales pitch! Reading between the lines, "lots of potential" sounds like "needs rebuilding". We're taken to the site; it's an interesting looking plot near the corner of Winter Path & Ironpost St (technically, **12 Winter Path, Trade Ward**) with a small one story tower extension at the front, a wide door underneath. We head inside. It's a mess alright - but the more we investigate, the more surprised we get. Inside the main door is a circular hallway under the tower, with a circular chandelier of sorts - the kind that's just a big metal ring with candle mounts - and various hooks and nooks for coats and the like. Narrow double-doors, of the sprung kind that "flap" open in either direction, lead into a main room. It's dirty, some broken windows and boards dimming the light, but there's a long bar near a closed-up fireplace and another centrepiece iron ring chandelier.

It strikes us at this point, very unexpectedly - wait, what? Something here feels... Right.

We dig deeper, investigating. Various small rooms on the level above, two of which have small balconies overlooking the street below. Much of the problems are cosmetic. Few are structural. Charlin chatters endlessly about plans - adding in a door for delivery access into the kitchen rather than needing to go through the main tavern floor, proper ways to set up the cellar below and so-on. Split between the cellar, main floor with bar and back-room kitchen, bedrooms above and a small tower room up top, there's a surprising amount of space.

Sometimes you just feel it in your bones. Charlin's busy train-of-thought rattling of a hundred ideas. The agent is making approving noises as part of his sales technique. But the four of us stand in that main room and just look to each other. There's a glint in Gnog's eye. The others too. What happens next happens quickly. Gnog has a quiet word with the agent. It's a surprising revelation. He actually seems a little downtrodden; it turns out there's a complicated history with the man's brother and this building which had fallen into disrepair and, in the end, the agent never really wanted to run a tavern so has been trying to move it on. He's not normally a property agent and perhaps his rather transparent sales pitch banter should have given away his inexperience. Charlin is still poking around inside when we quietly broach the question. Never mind rental. The man doesn't want the hassle of rental, he has plans that need money for a university course and a family; he has income anyway, but he never thought anyone would ever ask... **How much to buy it?**

* Fee-Ree has a pearl, 100gp worth.
* Garren holds little coin but produces 10gp.
* There is agreement for Gnog to dip into party funds. We can scrape 890gp for purchase and are told that we'll need 120gp for legal fees.
* Deni, out of nowhere - quietly collecting things after battles as she does - produces 1000gp. It's all she has. This is to work as collateral and will be held in the form of a 1000gp emerald at the Magistrate's Office until the 1 year point.

All she has... This wild child, always surprising Gnog and, once again, proving her extraordinary character. Gnog is choked up again. It's pride, and love and admiration, enough to burst.

Charlin realises what we're doing. He almost protests, but he can see we're set on this... He'll be the operator. Charlin & Chaps, proprietor of this place. We'll be owners, at least initially, but he won't have to worry about rent. We can fund startup costs and if it eventually turns a profit, we can figure out where we go from there; but it takes off the pressure. Charlin isn't sure why we'd do this? **Because you were there for us from the start, and you waited, and we're friends, and we care for each other**.

The deal is done. It doesn't even take very long, despite some legal wrangling and paperwork; our now-friend agent is able to expedite the process and delighted with the outcome.

**We have bought ourselves a Waterdavian tavern**.

It feels more significant than it might. This is the beginning of something. New roots, new opportunity. A meeting place, a significant location for friends; destiny is a heavy word, but how else can we explain the feeling in our hearts when we stepped into that dusty, dim main room? **We're every bit as excited as Charlin**.



### The Goliath Drinks

The tavern, once again, is at 12 Winter Path, Trade Ward; the corner of Winter Path & Ironpost St. Since Charlin still has our old "fake"-not-so-fake drinks trading wagon from the caravan, he says he'd like to somehow mount it up on the roof or above the door and we want to keep the name: **"The Goliath Drinks"**.

Once again, things move quickly from here. The pace of city life is quite a change from prior adventures (and our group will find this in future, too; a single day in the city can be packed full of meetings and discoveries). While preparations start in the tavern, we venture out to try and sell some of our artefacts - tavern ownership appears to be an expensive business.

* **Finnegan Terl's Rare Traders** (North Ward) takes Denni's art objects & the obsidian black dragon figurine, 400gp all in, and expresses enthusiasm especially about the figurine - if we find more unusual art objects in future, we should perhaps return here.

* K**arabash's Figurines Of Winder** (Siren Lane, off Silk St, Castle Ward) gives us 4800gp for various objects (not detailed in original notes, sadly and memory has faded). That's a huge sum and again they're keen for more. It seems Finnegan is good for lower-scale pieces, Karabash for high-end.

We know about a Harper safe house, all the way up in Field Ward - Twelve Dogs Court - "**Fearless Fletcher**". Ianfeard is the half-elven owner. We may be interested in unusual arrows for Deni in future. In the mean time, he gives us advice.

* The dragon scales could be turned into elven or giant scale armour
* **Blackstaff Vajra** may be able to make a magical rod from the dragon horn
* The dragon blood should go to a herbalist to become poison, or perhaps alchemist for potions
* The teeth could go to a master carver or stoneworker, perhaps, to become daggers

There are various avenues of enquiry for this, from local galleries all the way up to checking in at Red Larch. We might not have time for much of it.

We actually end up taking the teeth to Karabash, who had seen them earlier and expressed an interest. For 60gp he can get two of them worked on to produce daggers. Done! The others he says have useful poison but require magical treatment, and he has a different recommendation for that - **Balthor's Rare & Wonderous Treaures**, just north of Buckle Alley, East side of Street Of The Sword.

On the way there, we investigate Manycats Alley. At the end is a shop with one of the longest names we've yet seen - **Sulmist's Splendid Shoes & Boots & Garments & Bags**! We head in, under the guise of seeking a Bag Of Holding - technically it'd be our second, but Gnog thinks if we get split up as a party, we need to make sure - since we have the financial means - that we don't have all our metaphorical eggs in one metaphorical basket. Sulmist proves a persuasive host, taking us into a back room full of his more special (read: magical) items and we end up with a plethora of very useful things:

* A somewhat ragged, cut-price Bag Of Holding that Gnog disguises further by putting inside his old sack
* Boots of Elvenkind - very handy for stealth!
* Clothes Of Mending - Gnog gets a wardrobe upgrade
* A self-refilling spice bag; this delights Fee-Ree and, in turn, the rest of us as it means a significant upgrade to our on-trail food excitement!

Finally, we get to Balthors; a big grand opening which leads into a crazy, bigger-on-the-inside place of magic and wonder. A circular, no-handholds/rails disc levitates people between huge floors dedicated to various kinds of magic; almost all of one floor is dedicated to weaponry, with an entire side of the building containing numerous magical swords. Prices are on most things and many are far, far beyond our means - some into six figures of gold pieces - but it's a real treasure trove. We explain that we have *parts* to sell and are seeking manufacture of custom weapons and are brought up on the floating disc to a workshop of expert magical weaponsmith dwarf **Jorun**. It transpires in conversation, having seen Gnog's axe, that he knows of Dwendalyn and Braenor at Nesmay and admires their work. After some discussion and deliberation, we will have made:

* 5 poison dragon tooth crossbow bolts (takes only a day)
* 1 giant dragon tooth spear (3 days)
* A dragon tooth dirk (3 days)

There's a deal struck for our dragon scales in return and we're net up, by a *lot* - 8 trade bars promised (not on-site; pick up tomorrow). We keep the dragon hide for Deni, because we're told that the Dock Ward has tanners and leatherworkers who ought to be able to make something quite special out of that. 

After a long day, we get back to the work-in-progress Goliath Drinks. There is more cleaning, fixing and tidying; the kitchen is up and running, so food can be prepared; **and we sleep there, in our own tavern, for the first time**.



## WATERDEEP DAY 2, 3

We are mostly in a holding pattern at this point, working on the tavern or general Waterdeep exploration and waiting for the council to convene on the matter of the dragon cult and eggs.

We learn that Leosin and Onthar are in town.

A visit to Book St takes us to Serpentil Books, where we find some useful maps and another gift for Janvair: A book on the Netherese Empire, and "Volo's Guide To Werewolves"!

Wwandering more, we end up near Caravan Court, off Robin's Way, at a beerfest! It is based in the House Of Good Spirit. This seems a good place to seek products for the tavern. We get various cards for both food and drink vendors - including a pie card and cake card! There are some really interesting things that could help make the tavern stand out in a crowded market; the key is the interest Waterdavians show in new things, along with noticing that while we're catering there to mostly a worker's market, it's not Dock Ward; there's a degree of affluence, so we can aim at a higher price point *but* aim at a very high quality to match. We're not into margins, we're into providing the best food and drink we possibly can while still making enough money to pay for living costs of on-site staff, pay bills, and maintain the property.

It's been roughly a day by the time we're cycling back to Balthors, getting paid our trade bars for the dragon scales and picking up the crossbow bolts. We find we can now afford some very useful items - a Chest Of Preserving, which means we can take fresh food on-the-road with no fear of it ever spoiling; and two cold stones - we can put those down in the tavern cellar to create a chilled area for cold drinks and delicate food. Perfect!

We also do some PR! We end up speaking to people from the Daily Trumpet - an old tortle in particular - they're happy to feature new businesses and will visit the tavern in *three days* (eek, that's soon!) to try it out.

Finally we get down to Dock Ward with the dragon hide. We end up at Telethar Leatherworks, below Tower Trail on the waterfront. Tanning is underway.

More of this kind of thing in this and the next day - investigations, purchases, spending too much on food and drink...!



## WATERDEEP DAY 4

By the fourth day in this strange, busy city, our whirlwind reaches the point where the tanning is done and we commission red dragon hide armour for Deni.

We are walking out of Dock Ward and just about reaching the busy Waymoot when suddenly, we can't hear any sound - can't hear *ourselves* speak, even. Instead, there's a weird, loud, deep drone, a noise unlike anything we've heard. Everywhere around, people stop, looking astonished. We can't hear them or us, nobody can; it's a moment frozen in time.

Just as abruptly, this effect stops. We can hear normally but it's quiet, a hush. Then people start to move. Fortunately, there's not quite the panic we feared, but there's an urgency, a hush and hurry that is quite eerie. Some people seem to flee indoors abruptly. Traders and riders with horses are finding the animals hard to control. We notice birds aren't landing; they touch down, but lift off again, wheeling in flocks around, apparently distressed. There's a kind of pressure in the head, as if there's still that strange deep drone, but not quite consciously heard now.

All our good humour has evaporated. We rush to the tavern. Everyone is fine, but freaked out. Gnog spends time talking to the horses, having seen they were very distressed. The complain about the loud noise! It's very annoying and scary, though it's slowly getting quieter. Gnog tries to reassure and comfort them. He realises (and conveys to the others) that animals can still hear - or at least otherwise strongly sense - the same strange sound from earlier, especially through contact with the ground. That must be why birds keep landing then taking off again. At least it seems to be gradually lessening.

We make a beeline for the Harpers Chapterhouse. There, we find Leosin & Onthar, meeting with others, looking very worried.

**"We think it's the Draakhorn... The Draakhorn has sounded."**

This turns out to be one of what is becoming a common themes of our quest - a myth that isn't a myth. A very, very powerful magical horn that summons dragons. This signals a huge and abrupt jump in cultist activity; they are trying to draw chromatic dragons to them. **The location must be found urgently** but we lack the knowledge to do so. While this is going on, we end up meeting **Remalia Haventree**, leader of the Harpers who had come to Waterdeep for the council meeting and fortunately already here; and meet **Blackstaff Vajra** in person, a commanding yet young woman, very charismatic and surprisingly friendly / approachable despite her considerable status and magical power.

The council meeting is to be rushed forward, to 11pm tonight - the earliest that they can do with any chance of all attendees rushing in, and still being able to make it in time. Magical messages are sent.

As the day progresses and reports flood in to what becomes a Harper nexus here in Waterdeep, there is more disturbing news. Well-known old black dragon **Voraghamanthar** is on the move, having not strayed from traditional stomping grounds in decades. **Cryovane**, a young white that lives at the Sword Mountains (we realise this is the dragon we saw circling the peak that time, back when we were in the caravan on the Long Road) has also left. They're both heading in roughly the same direction, but not in a reliable enough path to figure out what the destination might be.

A tense, difficult day. The game is afoot. Finally, it's time for the council meeting.

We see many people and a huge amount of security on approach to the palace. We're let in with the paperwork we've been given and escorted through big doors and big hallways to the council chamber; a large, dramatic room, high roof, vast stained glass windows, long tables with individual chairs lining the left and right walls and a similar table, but elevated, along the far wall. It's impressive and intimidating in equal measure. People file in. Some we know, some we don't. There is reassurance that some people here know us.

Aside from us, and possibly having not recorded everything in full, I have noted the presence of:

* Lord Dagult Neverember (Open Lord of Waterdeep)
* Vajra Safhar (Blackstaff of Waterdeep), accompanied by members of Force Grey security
* Lady Remalia Haventree (Harpers)
* Onthar Frume, Paladin of Torn (Order Of The Gauntlet)
* Delaan Winterhound (Emerald Enclave) - 1/2 elf, rides a giant wolf!
* Ambassador Connerad Brawnanvil (representing Mithril Hall and dwarves of the North) - dwarf
* Sir Isteval (representing Daggerford)
* Marshal Ulder Ravengard (representing Baldur's Gate) (Leader of The Flaming Fist)
* King Melandrach (King Of the Misty Forest and High Forest) - elf
* Taern Hornblade, AKA "Thundersmells" (!) (representing Silverymoon) (former Mage Protector of Silverymoon)
* Lady Dala Silverhelve (representing Lady Silverhand of Waterdeep who cannot make this meeting)

Relatively complex but not tense negotiations proceed. We are asked to tell our story in summary, amongst stories from others; but in the end, everyone heard the Draakhorn, so it's not like there's disbelief over the threat. I don't have detailed notes here; we played this in full, it was amazing, but it was deeply immersive and so isn't written down at all sadly.

Most people ultimately are approachable, except perhaps King Melandrach who is the most aloof and unwilling to commit. There is much bad blood historically between the elves and dwarves, so there is some friction there. In time we'll come to better understand why; if an elf can live thousands of years and are able to ascend to planes beyond this one, they are likely to think more carefully about the risk to which they might put themselves defending others; but the elves also let down the dwarves, after the dwarves had helped them. Difficult. This is really the only sticking point we encounter overall though.

In the end, our story along with others, the number of friends we have already in agreement and other factors *give us our first great win*.

**An alliance is formed.**

* We are given a writ granting us access to *any places* for information / investigation / travel and so-on. Basically it's a key to this city and any other that has any kind of recognition of Waterdavian authority. **Outstanding**.

* Our actions and investigations will be overseen by the council. Of course, all of the other members have their own parts to play. Closest to ours will be the actions of the Harpers, we think, but if there's war coming, it's going to take the combined efforts of as many of these disparate groups as we can pull together if we're going to have any chance at all.

Initial bootstrap investigations from the Harpers point us to two main options as far as the Draakhorn location goes.

1. Speak to another Wyrmspeaker - there's a known wearer of the **white Dragon Mask** (the five chromatic masks, meant to give the wearer some persuasive sway over dragons of that colour, are another myth-coming-true). It's a **dwarf called Varram**, last seen near the **Serpent Hills, close to Boareskyr Bridge**.
2. The Draakhorn itself did have a known location a long time ago - in the Sea Of Moving Ice, in the far north. Its location was deciphered by a reclusive and believed-aligned-evil group known as the **Arcane Brotherhood**. It was a subject of specific study by Tiefling sorcerer Maccath The Crimson, who had departed for the North in search of it but has apparently not been heard of for some 3 years now. Quite how the Harpers have such specific information about people within an organisation that is as secretive as we're being told - the Brotherhood - is something they aren't keen to divulge; protecting sources. Fair enough.

We debate within the party for a while. Capturing the white dragon mask, we are told, may give us an advantage if it comes to fighting Tiamat herself - but frankly we'd rather stop things well before then, if we can! This Varram character is probably going to be hard to convince, while if we were able to pull off locating and rescuing Maccath - well, then we have a reason for an alliance, however uneasy it might be.

We go for option 2. It is settled. We get some excitement when we hear that one of Waterdeeps fastest warships is to be employed to convey us to the city of Luskan, after which we can take a more appropriate boat with a local crew into the Sea of Moving Ice. **The ship leaves in two days.**

It's a very late night, but goodness, what a productive one - a new alliance and a new plan.



## WATERDEEP DAY 5

We are surprised by someone friendly sending several people, bearing palace writs, who wake us up early at the Golaith Drinks offering to help with setup, including all the guild paperwork that would normally take quite some time. Everything from firewood to plumbing, too.

We head out to get glassware, crockery and utensils. Various places!

* Alibaba's Cave, north of Caravan Court is great for utensils and crokery.
* Steins of Stonegaard is able to supply some great and quite unique tankards.
* Alhambra's Alembics has perfect glassware with a good variety. It'll help with the tavern's aspirations to sell better wine than some of the competing outlets.

They'll all be sending things to the tavern ASAP. It costs a bit extra to get that kind of service, but it's well worth it.

We catch up with Carlon, who says he's finished his current mission in the north. We hear he has a loved one down South, a long way away, who he left almost two years ago. He hopes she's waited. He is heading South on a mission and thinks he might be able to meet her.

Before he goes he recommends a book at the library - "Elminster's Primer On Chromatics" - and we seek this out. It proves **very** useful!

We have the presence of mind, thanks to Fee-Ree who has become quite taken by the nightly rise and elegant drift of Waterdeep's countless driftglobes, to see if Balthor's has something like that. We're not good in dark spaces! Indeed, they have exactly such a thing, perhaps unsurprisingly; not cheap at all, 200gp, but we figure it's such a useful item that it's well worth it and pay the price (after some token, and rather unsuccessful, attempts at barter).

On return, the tavern is about to open - that very day! It seems right and proper at this point to notice its true and correct proprietors: Charlin's Chaps.

* Charlin Parkin
* Renwith Coppoerpot
* Druanna Copperpot
* Vaskan Smithson

In contrast to the dark times of the previous day, there is respite in the elated, party atmosphere of the opening night. Quite a rush. Of course we aren't expecting many people into a new venue but in practice there is a steady stream of customers who seem mostly happy. We are delighted to see our Tortle friend from the Daily Trumpet, who *seems* very happy with the time he spends there, though he might just be being polite!

We have an unexpected visitor that night. Delann, the wolf-riding 1/2 elf ranger. He explains his discomfort that we'd noticed during the council meetings - he hates towns. Yearns for the wild. Gnog gets that, for sure! He brings **greetings from Noohar & Selvek**, two of the elves that we met on the caravan. It's nice to hear some news from that "previous life", which suddenly seems a very long time ago, despite being, what, barely a (10 day) week ago?

He talks also of **Turlang**, "grandfather" of tree ents - possibly the oldest tree in Faerun. Gnog hopes to meet Turlang one day. He also makes us aware of the Emerald Enclave symbol - a stag's head, akin to a golden stag emblem we'd seen but not recognised from the caravan elves. Hidden in plain sight!

It is good to have spent time with him.

It's getting late and we have an early start, we're told, for the ship. What a day - the tavern open, humming along, Charlin happier than Gnog's ever seen. The whole party feels a strong extended family connection here. We're delighted at the outcome and have fallen very much in love with this place. It makes Waterdeep a second home.



## WATERDEEP DAY 6

A misty morning, chilly. A dray arrives to take us to the docks. And what a treat. We are taken not just to the regular docks - but to the Royal Navy Dock. There, we see berthed the beautiful **Deepwater's Fury** - a grand galleon, jewel in the navy's crown, fastest in the fleet. We meet **Captain Arabella** and are pleasantly surprised to find **Lada Dala** there too; it seems she is to come along to try and broker a relationship if possible with the Brotherhood.

Loading isn't until 9am, but we have much to discuss around two main options:

1. Regardless of Lady Dala's mission, we can (after dropping off Lady Dala) sail straight to the Sea of Moving Ice to try and find Maccath directly. The boat we're taking is not built for it, but can still navigate there and it saves time.
2. Go to Luskan and try to gain an audience with the Arcane Brotherhood. This could give us vital information or assistance to narrow down the search; the Sea of Moving Ice is vast.

Part of the problem is that Maccath is shielded from scrying or detection. She either doesn't want to be found, or is being hidden. There is a rumour that she was seeking the Draakhorn via a particular dragon that had hoarded it and the Host Tower of the Brotherhood at Luskan might have the dragon's name, which would help a *lot*. She'd be sending regular messages to the Tower, so what was the most recent and what was in it?

Clearly, option 2! It was not really up for debate in truth; our party would not in good conscience leave Lady Dala without guard - well, aside form her bodyguard, the stalwart and likeable **Dimha Torquay** - in a city that is as rough as Luskan's reputation leads us to believe it will be. Besides, diving into the Sea of Moving Ice with no idea where we're headed is foolhardy and Gnog knows enough about the frozen North to realise that you don't try to make do with incorrect equipment if you know that better options are available - and Luskan has better ships for that job, however impressive Deepwater's Fury might be in warmer waters.



## To Luskan

The voyage is interesting; we keep out of the way, help where we can, learn more about Dala in conversations, warm to her despite an inevitable aloofness arising from her wealth and status; she's as down-to-earth as one might really ever be given her background and upbringing and really does seem to have a genuine warmth towards and care for all folk, regardless of their perceived 'class' in society. This is an impressive person who may have wealth that was inherited, but has status that was clearly earned.

In due course, we arrive at Luskan. It is a strange place, divided by the deep chasm of the river, bridges guarded at each end. The dock side we arrive on feels pretty rough; our initial impressions are not great, though we will come to appreciate this town more once we know the people (and over the months to come, we find this is often true; the people make the place).

Lady Dala manages to find a way "in" to the tower - via a bribe, pretty much, of someone called **Jendrick The Blue**. She has many contacts here. She tells us that **Zelen The White** is the person we *really* need to contact - Vajra found him originally - but we don't have that contact yet. There's also someone we need to avoid there; **Druette The Raven**, "Overwizard of the North Tower", who we are told is likely to be very hostile to our cause. We also learn that the Archmage Arcane at the tower is **Cashaan The Red**.

We have lodgings on the rougher dock side, but they're safe. Dala knows the area.

### To the tower

In due course, we make our way down to the tricky crossings that get us to the tower. We meet Jendrick and are led through arcane barriers across a rock bridge, then around to a low side door, not anywhere near what would appear to be the tower's main entrance. We are directed up flights of stairs on the outer side of the tower, which seems split in half (semicircles) by functions at various levels. Eventually, we reach a grand room and have to wait. A while later, none other than Zelen The White returns with Jendrick. We have met who we needed to - Dala's bribe was significant! - and it turns out her persuasiveness about how we might be able to help them was good too (rolled by DM).

Information flows quickly.

* Yes, they did hold the Draakhorn. It was stolen.
* **Arveiaturace** is an ancient white dragon; she had loved a rider once, Meltharond, who died but had magic that held him together through the stresses of riding and this persisted after his death - she carries his skeleton upon her back.
* Arveiaturace is courted by the younger, arrogant **Arauthator** - he is her mate, but she is quite dismissive and he always seeks her attention. It was *this* dragon that Maccath sought, believing him to have been aggressively pursuing magic items for his hoard to try and impress Arveiaturace.
* The last time the Tower heard from MacCatch was **eighteen months** ago! They know this:
  - She was headed to Icewind Dale, because Arveiaturace had been seen near there and she thought that perhaps Arauthator might have a lair nearby.
  - Through this process, she discovered that Arauthator had a hidden hoard on an island lair within the Sea Of Moving Ice.
  - MacCath found passage into the Sea with a dwarf, three red-headed clansmen and a golaith as guards. They set out on a longship.
  - The island she had reported to be a myth of sorts. "Isle Of Eternity" - **Oyaviggaton**.
  - She had reported strange, hostile behaviour from ice hunter groups in the area. They often fled if approached. Many were reported heading back to a strange flattened iceberg of sorts.
  - Its location is unknown but there is a general idea of interest - because of an attempt to hide it. The wizards are powerful and ought to be able to scry the region to find the island, but instead there's a very powerfully protected blank spot. It's a 5km radius, which is a huge area of sea - but an awful lot *less* of an area than we'd have to search otherwise! It's a very good place to start looking.
  - The suspicion is that MacCath has been captured or killed by Arauthator himself, since ice hunters would be unlikely to be capable of subduing a wizard of her skill. That means Arauthator may actually *present himself* at this island - not over near Icewind Dale with Arveiaturace.

That's all they have on her. But then, to our surprise, more is confessed.

* In greatest confidence: Six *vitally* important magic books for the Red Wizards had been stolen, not just the Draakhorn. They kept this strictly secret as the loss of these weakens them considerably and they are vulnerable to attack, especially from their main enemies, the Red Wizards of Thay. We *MUST NOT* allow this loss to be known outside the tower.
* We are to try and recover these books. The promise to at least try and the promise, if any are found, to return them is a big part of why they're even talking to us. It seems Dala, and perhaps others working through strange channels of covert diplomacy, have laid a solid ground to bring us to this point.
* There is more. Due to his totemic abilities, **Gnog is given a gift** - well, a loan! - of fey spirit, white snow owl **Ryme**, with a *six mile* telepathy range. This is the familiar of Zelen The White, so this is no small gesture and Gnog is very sincere in his thanks and his commitment to return Ryme unharmed.

When we leave, plans are drawn up rapidly. Dala has learned of a **Captain Lerustah,** who has ship **Frostskimmr**, a very fast and capable boat designed for the Sea of Moving Ice. We head to South Of The Run to find him.

Deni has two dragon-killing arrows and we have two scrolls of protection against cold. We figure that's all going to be... Very important.

In due course, at the tavern, we meet Lerustah. He is a very classic, piratey-kind of Captain, but someone that just *exudes* competence and - surprisingly - trustworthiness. Gnog immediately likes him. He has a dog (husky-style) to which Gnog has limited conversations, typically starting by the dog saying "Sausage?!" and refusing to negotiate thereafter until the request is satisfied!

The deal is done - we charter his boat and crew.

Since we don't know how long it'll take to find what we need, we have to charter the maximum possible voyage duration of which this boat is capable. It leads to a crew of *forty*, astonishingly, with three weeks of supplies to be loaded on the Frostskimmr.

*We are attacked* after leaving, on our way back to the other side of the river - we are near an area with old city relics, a park/museum of sorts, with Dala and her bodyguard Dimha; we are set upon, an assassination attempt. We fight well, Dimha performing admirably as part of our wider body of fighters and we prevail... But it is sad, in the end. When checking the deceased we find a note. This was, in fact, a crew; down on their luck, short on money, it would seem, so they appear to have taken on an assassination job. Dala was the target. This is a shock to her as she does not know of enemies of that nature here - we posit, probably dragon cultists who don't like how close we are getting to locations and people closely associated with the Draakhorn. We never do, though, find out who ordered this to be done.

* We get back to our lodgings and insist that Dala head off, with Dimha. The Fury waited a few days and is still in port; she can return to Waterdeep, her job very well done.
* She thanks us for our help and protection and we thank her, in return, for her extraordinary success in getting the meeting at the Tower.
* They leave; without her assurances of protection and, knowing we might be being watched, we change inn! We move to the **Wright's Arms**. It's a room we feel we can watch and defend overnight on our own terms.

### Sehanine's Bow

On investigation of the crew and their belongings, we realise that they weren't just a crew in town looking for work - **they were a crew with a ship**. The name we have is **Sehanine's Bow**. We investigate at the docks; the dockmaster knows the boat, with outstanding docking fees. We have to tell him what happened but he seems fairly nonchalant about it - it seems that the defence of an assassination attempt is taken at-your-word in Luskan and so, rightfully, we have the ship as salvage.

Wait, what?!

It apparently can take up to 20 crew to run at full efficiency / capacity. Small cargo vessel, reasonably fast and agile. It's in decent condition. The name on the bow is accompanied by the symbol - of Sehanine, the Elven Goddess of the Moon. Docking fees are 5sp/night, so we pay 15gp up-front for at least 30 days, since we don't know how long we'll be away (or what on earth we'll do with a ship after that!)



## The Frostskimmr

### Day 1

We board this strange vessel. It is long, shallow-hulled and narrow. The only space is on deck, either fore or aft, with space down the middle needed for people moving between rowing positions when cycling on or off shift. Lean-to tarps, of sorts, are set up by crew; we set up in the bow, under instruction of how to keep out of the way. This will, we are assured, not be be much of a comfortable journey, but it'll certainly be in a vessel very well suited to the waters and we're assured of fast passage.

We depart. Larustah's dog is left with a trusted friend - it can't fit on the boat with a full crew, us and all supplies for this length of journey. At least Gnog had saved it one last sausage and is able to talk to it to explain what's happening.

### Day 2 - Level 8

There is a battle with Sahuagin, that attack the ship at night. We defend well, but lose a crewman who is pulled overboard and drowned `:-(`

### Day 3 - Sea Of Moving Ice

We are amongst the icebergs. A strange environment. Gnog finds it stark and very beautiful; the others are dressed against the cold, but not as comfortable here as Gnog. Over the day we see two different packs of ice hunters, but they both flee. Larustah is surprised at this because he finds them usually somewhere between curious and friendly; we are less surprised, given what we were told at the Tower (but we're keeping all that to ourselves).

We find an iceberg with a high wall and a lower edge that is ideal for camping with the wall protecting the back. At night we've noticed that now and again lights of, presumably, other camps can be seen and since we've no idea who is friendly or hostile we're always trying to keep hidden. The boat is pulled up onto the ice and used as a physical form of shelter too.

That night, 3 ice trolls attack; we defeat them, fortunately, with no casualties.

### Day 4

More ice hunters and, again, they flee; for a while we follow their course, but they're faster, our pursuit is hardly helping with their anxiety and, besides, we have a search area we want to stick with for now.

### Day 5 - Success!

The island is spotted! Regular high flies with Ryme, that prior days had been fruitless, finally help Gnog see something suspiciously tall and unusual from a distance.

It's a strange place; two very, very tall peaks on one side forming what looks like a largely-unclimbable defence there, with a bowl depression that has high walls of fairly sheer ice dropping to the sea for most of the rest of the circumference. It does taper down in one area as a "tongue" of ice down to sea level and it's very clear that this is used for bringing in kills given the clearly visible and somewhat gory marks visible on the ice there even from a distant flight. Gnog is careful not to let Ryme get too close; we don't know who is watching. So details are sketchy. But we're all sure that this seems very likely to be "it".

Curious, though, says Larustah - the ice hunters don't settle; they'd over-hunt an area and run out of food. Yet there are signs of a fairly well established village and the markings on the "ice beach", so visible from a distance, indicate a long history of kills.

We have a sneaking suspicion that the hunters are feeding more than just themselves.

That night, an unexpected breakthrough. On watch, a swimmer is spotted in the ocean, lying on part of a broken boat and paddling with his hands. There is a dead hunter there too. Understandably he's in a very bad shape but we nurse him back to health. He'd been attacked by the tribe on the island! The hunters on the island are aggressive and they apparently got too close. He knows where his tribe is and we vow to return him.

### Day 6

We divert to return our rescued tribesman. They are grateful and want to offer us something in thanks; quick-thinking Larustah negotiates a small 2-paddle kayak. It's *just* big enough for the four of our party to use if we want to try and stealth our way onto the island.

There seems no way to get the ship there, but on the "back" of the island where large ice peaks/"mountains" (ish) shield the view of anyone in the main village, there's a melted hollow that the ship could fit into. Under cover of night, we navigate in there and have the ship wait. If they fear danger or we're not back in a day or two, they should flee.

We paddle around and get onto the "landing" area without discovery. There seems no other way up without being seen or heard/smelled by dogs in the village. We make it as far as an approach path and find, frozen into the ice there, a few dead adventurers. A grim discovery and it seems that they are frozen in full view on this path as a warning - we're not sure to whom, but start to get the feeling that the islanders here might be unwilling participants in something since it'd surely take either a strong mage or a white dragon's breath to do something like this. We see enough of the party members to surmise a high likelihood that these were some of MacCath's travelling companions. We find a place to hide out and avoid detection.

### Day 7

It's a bit like our time in the Mare of Dead Men; we manage to find an empty hut, but then end up finding it not so empty as a shamen, **Bone Carver**, discovers us. RP follows! Gnog's animal totem alignment is key here; we each recognise totemic powers in each other and, despite difficulties in translation, we learn enough about there being some kind of prophecy that had predicted their group falling under the sway of a great evil (the dragon, we figure) but being rescued by - another one of those unsettlingly accurate prophecies! - a band of four, who will be known by a shared totem. **A physical ice totem is gifted to Gnog as a gesture of goodwill**.

We eventually agree that we will be taken to Chieftan **Barking Seal** but he is unconvinced by stories of prophecy. Our strength must be proven. A champion is brought forward; **Orca Heart**. He is fought; it is not an easy battle, as we want strength to be demonstrated, not weapon prowess and fight unarmed. Gnog manages to defeat the champion (non-lethally!) and, with our strength proven and the prophecy apparently being realised, it is agreed that we can be permitted to proceed to caverns below the surface.

We rest to recover...

### Day 8

...unti 1am, technically day 8, when we proceed via a hidden access in Bone Carver's tent to the caverns below. Much stealthing around; we encounter and must kill an ice troll, to avoid the alarm being spread.

It takes a while and a lot of nervous moments but we stumble upon a chamber and there is **MacCath herself**.

* She has been trapped here Arauthator who wants to learn her secrets
* In particular he feels he can learn the power of the Draakhorn and perhaps gain advantage in his ongoing courtship of Arveiaturace through his thus-proven intellect
* The stolen books from the Red Wizards are all here, but warded
* The dragon can leave the lair underwater and fly out to attack anyone who tries to escape, but isn't continuously watchful, since that's what the tribe above is for
* This is probably the only reason we were able to sneak in so close with the Frostskimmr.

We learn that ice toads run this level. MacCath will help us fight the dragon if we wish to do that, but we'll beed to take care of things in this level or be fighting on two fronts. MacCath also tells us that the ice trolls were actually the former 'owners' / sole inhabitants of this land and might be allies if given sufficient motivation.

Under directions, we make our way to the ice toad caverns. **Malfurb** is the matriarch there. We try to convince her to help, since ultimately none of the creatures here are happy being under the thumb of a dragon, but they're possibly evil-aligned and will only act if "lawful" and in their interests; chaotic creatures would let the world burn anyway, so we must be cautious. We have some mis-steps in RP, but eventually Malfurb at least agrees that no attacks will be permitted on this level of the caverns - but there is a dragon and *two scrags* in the caverns below and *they* are our problem.

Continuing explorations, we find the ice trolls. Very good rolls here in RP lead to 6 agreeing to help, on a "kill or be killed" basis; they're running out of food, they can see the writing on the wall and at this point anything that gives them a new option is welcome.

Investigations below are dicey. A large cavern at one end, lots of ice columns, scrags patrolling; it splits into two passages at a far end by a high dividing ice wall - but not one which fully touches the ceiling curiously - as it heads towards the lair of Arauthator and his minor hoard, with apparently his exit tunnel. With shock, seeing this geometry and realising how it relates to the levels above, we recognise the truth of the handy melted cavern area in which Frostskimmr is parked - **that is where Arauthator's tunnel exits!** If the dragon flees and Frostskimmr is still there, they'll be killed.

We use the high dividing wall as a perilous route for exploration to find this out, which is handy as it transpires wards and traps are present in the tunnels either side. Arauthator is no fool but apparently didn't consider this high, narrow central route - it's cramped, crawling needed and only Deni really has the dexterity for it, so perhaps the dragon figured that nobody of any threatening size or power could really do much there.

Before long, the plan is afoot. The idea is to fight the scrags together, so we can get them down quickly but draw out the dragon from the noise of battle. Various other parts of the plan are put into place and we get going.

* In battle, the scrags split up almost immediately so within about 6 seconds our plan is already onto later letters of the alphabet.
* Garren ends up facing down a scrag solo, cutting one off from heading towards the dragon's lair, while we are facing the other. He gives no quarter and takes a beating but defeats the creature single-handed. This is one of several defining moments that strongly illustrate his bravery, valour and proficiency in battle. Gnog grows more impressed with Garren every passing day.
* The dragon is drawn as we intended and squeezes down one of the two passageways to appear in the main cavern just as we take down the Scrags.
* The trolls start to descend into the cavern at the signal of the passing dragon, coming in behind it. The dragon sees them and its roar frightens many, so there are few left fighting - but even so, they distract it in the critical first few seconds.
* We have further advantage from the confined space stopping Arauthator using much range magic or lair actions (since this isn't his lair).
* The battle proceeds; we're getting beaten up, MacCath has retreated to a high corner and is apparently of a "nah, fuck this" mindset - frightened perhaps, but not admitting it if so! - but then Fee-Ree casts Storm, which slows Arauthator down further and lets us get some more attacks in (at the expense of being in the storm ourselves)
* We're low but winning. Arauthator wants to flee, but the storm hampers progress. In the central divide, one of the trolls swings and hits and (this not being faked, the dice don't lie) strikes a killing blow! It's very poetic; their land was invaded and taken over, but they get to take it back.

**We're *almost* down - but standing nonetheless. Impossibly, not a single troll has died; and there, very much dead, lies Arauthator.**

So then it's just the cleanup and worries about retaliation from Arveiaturace or the dragon cult.

* One or two books are missing but we find just about everything, either up where MacCath was being 'forced' to study - in truth, much of that was fine for her, a quiet place to read out the Draakhorn! - or in the minor lair at the other end of the caverns, the warded tunnel now being readily traversed since it has no dragon to warn anymore.
* Returning to the upper levels, we are set upon by cobalts. We had somehow missed them in our prior sweep and it seems they *did* like having the dragon around. There isn't time to talk about it; they're taken down easily, if a rather regretfully since further loss of life at such a stage seems really pointless.
* Most ice toads and the villagers are free! They can go to new hunting grounds; the toads can return to their true homes. There is rejoicing and many goodbyes.
* Malfurb wants to see the world! She wants to come with us and MacCath, so that is agreed.
* The victorious and elated ice trolls take back the ownership of their home.

There is one grisly task; we take time to cut free and use MacCath's frozen crew, taking their bodies carefully below, to stage a scene with cultist robes so that it looks like cultists themselves tried to attack Arauthator and killed the dragon but died in the process. MacCath is quite cold about it all, no pun intended, but it's not something we do lightly. These were good people, but in death, they can do more good yet; rather than remaining uselessly frozen as a long-forgotten warning, they might now help misdirect the cultists and - perhaps, if there isn't too much scrutiny from her - Arveiaturace herself.

It hasn't taken that long really. By the time everything is done, it's only just daylight. Tired, injured but successful, we row around to fetch Frostskimmr. The Captain brings her to the main dock and we load on Malfurb and MacCath, gifting the kayak back to the departing villagers.

Gnog has a close moment to say goodbye to Bone Carver in particular, with which he shares a bond through the totem; and the valiant Orca Hart too:

**"Giant of the ice - our paths will not cross again in this world, but I will see you in the next"**. He gives Gnog a necklace of animal teeth from various kills. In that culture, it means a lot and Gnog knows it. (Gnog will treasure this for many months before passing it on in turn to Eliastra before the final battle in this war, as a sign of solidarity and connection; she will understand its significance).

So, Captain; **best speed to Luskan**.



## Return to Luskan

### Day 1 (arrival)

We make it back easily, no more fights, but no more comfort either. It was cramped *before* two more of us came on board, but at least Malfurb loves the cold! Larustah is happily reunited with his dog. "Sausage?"

* We return to our old stayover haunt, The Wright's Arms
* By 8pm we're at the Host Tower with MacCatch. We're met by **Jendrich**, **Zelen** and **Cashaan** again.
* They are (and we should hope so, too) very pleased to have their books back! Oh - yeah, and MacCath too.
* Gnog returns Rhym. Sorry to see that one go. A beautiful creature.
* Malfurb is offered the chance to stay at the tower and learn more. She accepts. She is in essence a strange kind of envoy; besides, we don't know who or what else we might encounter that leads us further North again so her knowledge of such things might come in useful at any time. 

### Day 2 early

Our attention turns to Sehanine's Bow. We need a crew. With Larustah's help, we narrow a shortlist of possible Captains quickly and settle on someone that's just one of those people that Gnog sometimes meets and immediately just *knows* they are right. Instant trust, immediate friendship. It's a strange instinct and perhaps a risky one, but it's never failed him yet. Crew, with pay:

* Ophithana (3g5s) (female half-elf) Captain
* Zilmorn Lastspell (2g9s) (male gnome) Helmsman and 1st Mate
* Hin-Dameh (2gp) (male human) Bosun and Technician
* Zehira Poha (2gp) (female human) Quartermaster and Navigator
* Morgan Stromborn (2gp) (changeling, pron. 'they') Weather Control, Navigator, Helmsman
* 13 other crew (3sp)
* Garren and Fee-Ree can stand in as doctor and cook possibly

We budget in total:

* 489gp per month for wages
* 300gp per month for supplies needed at sea (100gp/week) on Zehira's advice 
* 100gp per voyage repair contingency on Hin-Dameh's advice
* Shore leave for 13 crew is at 5sp/day rather than 3sp/day -> 195gp/mo total, or 78gp on top of normal wages
* Shore leave for officers includes no extra pay

### Day 2 late

We have moved very quickly. The ship is ready. The crew are dependable. We are stocked and ready to go. Gnog figured we'd wait until the morning, but Morgan tells us that the tides and winds are good now, and night sailing is no issue for them.

There are some somewhat emotional goodbyes. One last sausage for the dog. This place had seemed so unlikeable and hostile when we arrived, yet now, Gnog leaves a piece of his heart here - this is where we found our ship; this is where he found a remote village of ice hunters with which he shared a totemic power; it's all been quite incredible.

We quite literally sail into the setting sun.



## En route to Waterdeep

The ship is fast. Morgan is very good at finding good winds, or helping them along via magic sometimes. The crew starts to gel quite quickly. We realise early on that a chest of preserving of some sort would be helpful and vow to get one for the ship once in Waterdeep.

### Day 1 (arrived at Waterdeep)

In just five days time we are rounding the corner into the harbour; Ophithana is shouting information to, or receiving instructions from the harbourmaster like she's been here a hundred times and lived on the ship her whole life. A natural. In what seem like just a few moments, our *own ship* is docking at our second home of Waterdeep. Victory feels good.

The crew are fine doing their own thing. Shore leave and the practices of security and maintenance while in port are their bread and butter; we let them get on with it. We've let them all know about the Goliath Drinks and they're welcome any time, we'd love to see them and all that, but they're very independent and don't know us well. Many of the main crew have places they're familiar with in Waterdeep and like to return to favoured haunts.

We waste no time getting to the tavern. It's great to say hi and see everyone again. Then we're straight over to Balthors!

* We sell 4 claws from Arauthator and the longer horn
* A fifth claw is left for them to investigate properties; we consider a longsword, falchion or scimitar for Garren maybe
* Fee-Ree had an ice troll heart (!) which we sell
* Shopping!

Nice to spend the evening at the tavern. To our surprise, a few officers and crew do decide to turn up. A bit fancy, perhaps, our place! But drinks are free for our crew, of course. It's an interesting way to get to know them more. They'll never just be employees to us. They're not faceless. We make sure they know it.

### Day 2

Instructions from those coordinating the defence against the Dragon Cult are never far away. We learn we must leave ASAP for Baldur's Gate. The plan will be:

* Leosin as reported a last-known location of **Varram The White** along with the white dragon mask he is believed to carry
* Get to the Order Of The Gauntlet HQ at Baldur's Gate
* Portal to the city of Elturel from there
* Get horses and ride to Boareskyr Bridge
* Track down Varram from there

This means we have to make some quick preparations.

* We leave 600gp at Balthor's as an advance to make a 'cold' sword for Garren out of that fifth claw. It'll be a falchion. We'll collect it at some future time.
* We leave Glazheal's horn with Vajra; we've been carrying it around for a while in the bag of holding, unsure what to do with it, but she says she has some ideas for making a magical artefact of some kind
* Fee-Ree's increasing and somewhat grisly collection of dragon and troll blood is passed onto **Adren Erenaeth**, a reclusive and eclectic - but very proficient - alchemist recommended by Vajra. He's under a sort of house arrest due to his tendencies prior to perform rather dangerously uncontrolled magical experiments which, at one point, caused half of his house to simply vanish and took out a good chunk of an adjoining one. He's a very odd character but clearly knows his stuff and is excited to get to do some potion work on real dragon and troll blood, saying that very little of such things come his way these days.

There is some downtime, since we can't leave until ship preparations and some hiring are completed (they can't rely on Fee-Ree as a cook, for example, as we're often not there and we want the ship to be an independent going concern). We figure - **why not go to the Yawning Portal**?

It's an experience, as you might imagine, but **barman / owner Durnan** is a more down-to-earth and knowledgeable character than we expected. A seasoned adventurer in his day, we think. We have a good time there, even if it does cost a pretty penny - everyone pays tourist rates here, whether or not they're locals!

**We are attacked on the way home**.

In the streets of Waterdeep itself, cult members, in broad daylight, try to take us out. They fail, but we think it was more a show of access and power; a play of fear. Waterdeep is supposed to be as secure as one can reasonably get - its streets safe and well patrolled - yet cultists can get in and attack us readily, in daylight.

Much to think about and a more sombre evening arises. We know we'll be leaving early the next day, though, so we make the best of it. And it really *is* very good to be back here, amongst our friends. Still hard to believe we own a whole tavern *and* a whole ship now! Times have certainly changed, and changed quickly.

### Day 3 (back on Sehanine's Bow)

In the morning, we meet female halfling **Thandi Fingersnap**, who will be the ship's cook and cleric. One of the crew members wishes to stay in Waterdeep to catch up with family, what with all the rising talk of dragons and troubled futures and whatnot, so this brings us to 6 officers and 12 crew.

* So that drops us to 72gp extra per month shore leave / 180gp per month wages for crew
* Overall brings us to 510gp/mo wages at sea including officers
* Supplies remain at 300go/mo.



## Sailing to Baldur's Gate

Much reading and trying to keep out of the way. A few minor skirmishes, easily dealt with fortunately; no damage, no crew lost, injuries readily healed.

On the fifth day of the voyage, we get a short but compact and informative message from Vjara via sending stone.

* Leosin lost Varram at Boareskyr; last seen at Bolo's Tentside Inn
* There is a clue word: Didaerius / Didirius, we aren't sure; we just hear it. Could be a name, place, anything. It's another one of *those* clues.



## Baldur's Gate

The great, dangerous city in the flesh, at last; evening, low sun. Sadly, we have little time to take in the sights. The ship and crew are free to do as Ophithana wishes from here; good hunting, Captain.

Mindful of the time pressure with Leosin's tracking of Varram, we don't mess around. Straight off the dock we head directly via map to the Order Of The Gauntlet. It's near Blade & Stars Tavern, apparently; it takes a bit of finding and we knock on the door.

We are cautiously welcomed by **Vincent**. He's a strange and unusually *not* guarded character for somewhere that ought to be quite secure, old and a little eccentric, but is friendly and certainly doesn't seem *careless*. After a chat and some kindly-offered food and drink, he straight away agrees to casting the portal to get us to Elturel.

So, scarcely an hour or so after we arrived in dock...



## Elturel and Boareskyr Bridge

### Day 1 (arrival at Elturel)

...we step through a portal and arrive at Elturel. What an extraordinary place - the strange 'forever sun', its large elevated area with long, narrow garden strip and impossible stream, beautiful in total.

* We have arrived at inn/tavern "A Pair Of Black Antlers" which seems to be where the Order hang out
* We are welcomed politely; they seemed to know we would be coming
* We are told the Scarlet Scrivener is good for books and maps, so take some time for that as we need to know the lie of the land and try to do research on the strange 'Didirius' word but come up empty-handed on that
* **We buy horses.** We were going to rent, but figured we'd not in good faith be able to give any guarantee we can bring them back!

(We don't realise quite how long these horses will then be with us).

It is late, but there is time to travel further. There is light from the strange sun. Plains behind the city extend a long way towards Boareskyr Bridge, so we ride out that night, long shadows cast in front of us from the sun behind. In due course we go far enough that it fades and we camp.

### Day 2 (to Boareskyr Bridge)

Travel across the plains is easy but approaching the Bridge becomes somewhat traumatic. We have been talking openly about concerns regarding cultists hidden in plain sight, people who might expect us and attack and so-on ever since the attack at Waterdeep - and unwittingly driven Deni to some amount of paranoia. There is an exodus underway with many refugees at or trying to reach Boareskyr Bridge - some say that the whole area is dying and people are trying to leave - so once off the plains, we're in very busy roads and it's just messy.

Deni grows increasingly nervous and eventually Gnog decides to hoist her up to sit on his shoulders, him sat atop of his own horse, so she can get a good look around. There's nothing we can do about the feeling of being watched, but we can certainly watch back!
