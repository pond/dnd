# Gnog: Part 2.x - Final√©

Final battle:

...with red wizards at the 5 apexes, one per dragon colour; one wizard on the ground casting, one ~50ft above channelling energy towards the top of the central spire where Severin sends it to the ball of energy gathering centrally. Green dragon defeated by Garren. Gnog, Deni, Ket Mera. are attacking one of the wizard pairs - turns out Rath Modar is at the base; Gnog gets him down. No reincarnation. But interrupted energy flow is picked up by someone else; backup wizards must be in the shadows. Other alcoves now throw up protection - a rock wall by the one where we were rescuing prisoners (is blue, it transpires); a wall of shadow elsewhere (black wizards). Other forces have taken down the blue dragon, prisoners escape, roof is brought down to block tunnel. McCath + 2 are attacking Severin but are beaten down. Two teleport away, badly injured; McCath remains, starting to cast a new spell. Undead/devils are being called by the bad guys.  We regather near where Rath Modar was, and try to attack the guy 50ft up. Two smaller red dragons had come in and were attacking our forces, but now turn on the cultists - Severin is directing them; they need soul energy for the ritual at any cost & loss of the sacrifices means he'll use his own. They panic & try to flee as a body. Elven archers attack the wizards in the blue corner, the low wizard casting some kind of diamond protection & floating up towards the one above; small portals open and imps arrive. Elven archers & other forces tell Garren they can handle it, so he jumps back to us (Ketmera cast a Jump spell on so with that plus dash he just makes it across the floor to our adjacent corner). We're about 4 rounds in of the ritual now, with 10 rounds to complete. We can hear the sounds from the other side.

Another giant dragon lands outside, as the cultists are trying to flee - some even run back in again, trapped between the giant outside and the two smaller within. Our lion friend Thaneros attacks one of the reds inside & his party join in. The black corner has spread and a giant bone beast is emerging, radiant beams are focused on it but it's still pushing in. We finish with the red corner (Garren & I on a fly spell from Fee Ree, to tackle the 50ft one) & move to the white. The Gauntlet are tackling the black corner. Zentarim rush the green. Elves still tackling remaining wizard in blue, above the still-blocked escape tunnel. Centrally, McCath casts a sickening ray bolt towards a slashing chain spell that Severin had cast; anything it touches turns to dust; she looks drained after casting it and staggers backwards. Severn wears a brilliant white robe against strange, sickly dark almost charred looking skin, with a dragon mask comprising four colours. He uses a draconic presence and frightens a lot of people. McCath retreats.

We manage to take out the two white corner wizards (at a fair HP cost) and move near the centre. The elves are struggling in the blue corner. The Gauntlet are struggling with the black corner due to the large bone dragon. Severin sends down one of his chains which wraps around a red wizard there & draws life force, expanding the portal further. Fee Ree attacks the chain, but can't break it; throws a fireball bead to the green corner but they make saves. Deni attacks Severin with insight and gets a good hit, but he catches her with a chain in reaction. Garren breaks it, but Severin casts a scorching sphere spell at us. Thanks to potions, clothes or race, Fee Ree, Garren and Deni all make saves & have resistances and the damage isn't so great. The portal widens further and turns so that its opening faces upwards now, rather than sideways as previously; a vast white dragon head, previously seen just beyond, now emerges fully, screeching hideously before falling back. Gnog manages to break the chain attached to the red wizard, then flies up for a hit on Severin, who reacts with an attack and flies up higher now his chains are broken. Elves in the blue corner take one wizard down but desperately need healing and can't do anything except keep firing at the influx of creatures from Avernus. They're in serious trouble.

Deni gets in another good attack. Garren reacts to stop Severin's reactionary attack from hitting. A turn or so later, Garren *just* gets range underneath Severin (attack his feet!) via Misty Step & full fly, gets a huge hit in with L3 divine smite and it's enough - Severin falls. As he drops, Garren "uses" his 2nd attack, rolls really well and grabs the mask. Severin looks like he can barely believe it (end of Die Hard stylee); is being quite rude, then stabs *himself* as he falls directly into the portal mouth, casting something in an ancient language we cannot understand. Whatever he casts causes all the remaining cultist red wizards to drop dead on the spot, life force channeling into the portal with Severin. Garren meanwhile uses a reaction to throw the mask to Gnog, whose reaction is to throw it to Meorista who had lept up to almost 50ft; again, good rolls, she catches it, bounding away, calling for a portal; a wizard casts Dimension Door & she grabs the wizard as both of them portal away.

At this moment (all in slowmo!) one of the two red dragons that Thaneros' team isn't tackling makes a legendary action dash straight for the portal. Garren sees it coming and has time to stow weapon ready to switch. Gnog hasn't had the chance yet. Our remaining forces now race towards the main entrance, using all manner of magic to try and repel any further chromatic intrusions. We are, in essence, now locked into the temple and alone.

The red dragon passes us by and bypasses the portal - it heads directly to the red corner instead. It consumes the body of Rath Modar, then polymorphs slowly back into his form; a kind of speak-with-dead reanimates enough of the other recently diseased wizards for the ritual to resume. A few seconds in, Rath Modar is fully reformed and flies up above us towards the portal. At that moment, a white and black head of Tiamat emerge, and Rath Modar is torn apart, screaming, as Tiamat consumes him for more life force. Drawing on the rest of the mages, she continues to gain strength, as the portal slowly expands. It's only been a minute since the ritual started and we slowed it down enough to only have 2 heads so far, but Tiamat is pushing through the portal now and there's not much left to stop her.

All we can do is fight - just us five, now. The Goliath rages again, resisting exhaustion. Initially we try to stick close to Garren to try and be protected from fear, taking the risk of breath weapon attack; when it happens, its intensity is far greater than we feared and the plan changes in that instant. Fee Ree runs out to the East, Deni to the West; Garren, with a Vow Of Emnity, stands ground to tackle the black acid dragon head given his potion-sourced resistance and Gnog tries to get under the nearby white head to help. The green head appears and blasts Garren, but his poison immunity is a huge stroke of luck, as are the failure of several attempts to bite him during the battle overall. The black head, smaller than the others due to the lack of black mask, is weak; we manage to get it out of commission, but take more damage from breath weapons. A blue head appears and Deni scores a critical hit, but in reaction it launches a breath attack that does huge damage to Gnog and Deni. Ketmera, who had retreated some distance after being frightened briefly, rapidly regains composure and runs in to heal.

We keep trying. For a brief moment, the successful early attacks on the black head seem to have weakened Tiamat, but her strength is restored when the blue head emerges. It is difficult to get an effective hit to land. A druidic spell from Ketmera melts into mud part of the central roof support, leaving an opening; she sounds a horn, calling for aid. The red head appears on the Eastern flank of the beast and nearly kills Fee Ree. All five heads are present, the wings nearly through. We try to press on. Sarqarim Deorynus flies in on a griffon through the opening, and brings Fee Ree back from the brink. Tiamat emerges fully. A terrifying screech tries to inspire awe in us all - and fails, but Gnog is deafened. We battle on, healing spells mostly spent. Ketmera is shouting warnings that Gnog can't hear. Garren is by quirk of fate doing well for health and healing pool, but is out of spells except one being held back for the direst emergency; most of the party are low or spent. Although Tiamat looks injured, she still seems far from defeat.

Another attack from the blue head takes Gnog down, but his high level Goliath resistance bounces him back. One of Ketmera's last healing spells pulls him from the brink a little. Deafened and engaged with the wrathful might of Tiamat, unable to assess the battlefield, thinking his best chance is to get help from Garren, Gnog fumbles in his pockets to try and grab his best healing potion. He hopes to run and reach his friend while surviving any opportunity attacks from Tiamat - but Garren moves first. Gnog looks over and sees him running, suffering a horrible bite on the way, armour shattering in part - but he stays up. He lays hands on Gnog whose strength comes back in a huge, dizzying wave. Gnog steels himself for more, attacking the blue head once again with everything he has. The first blow hits, but doesn't seem to bother Tiamat all that much. The second attack, though, is in slow motion; it feels almost dreamlike to the deafened Gnog. A perfect strike; terrible damage.

The greataxe buries deep - and then Gnog isn't in the temple. He stands in a strange, barren land. It is laid waste, a lifeless vista of ashen grey. In front of him is an uninjured Tiamat. Since she had emerged from the portal slowly and since Gnog had attacked in close quarters from the outset, he had never previously witnessed the full size of this god. The enormity and power emanating from the creature is almost too much to grasp. Tiamat speaks - and to Gnog's astonishment, makes him an offer. He can end here, or choose a form of life, reincarnated as a dragon at her side. They will rule all planes together; "we will rejoin the world that I created".

At this hubris, something behind Gnog speaks. Gnog turns, realising that he'd somehow felt the presence before hearing it... A platinum dragon, unmistakably Bahamut. Equal in stature and might to Tiamat, this other god is equally awesome and terrifying.

Bahamut corrects Tiamat. "The world *we* created. It had to be torn asunder, and now it cannot be brought back; there are too many lives on too many planes. The creatures of the mortal realms must choose.. *You* must choose". He is asking Gnog to choose life, or choose his end. It is momentarily confusing; but life, Gnog surmises, means a dragon, ruling forever over a single unified plane of fire and death; or his end, but Tiamat vanquished and the worlds saved... His friends saved. It's the easiest decision he's ever made. "I... choose the end - you don't have sugar sheep..." - he's never been too good with words under pressure.

Bahamut speaks. "My love, the mortals have spoken. You must abide by their choice". Tiamat's heads rear back, then dive at Gnog. All five attack, and although it's only in Gnog's mind, the damage is real. The hardy Goliath can resist almost anything, but against attacks inside his own mind, he is defenceless. (Technically, 89 points damage; Gnog was at 1->18->78 thanks to Ketmera and Garren; HP max at the time around 168 (after Aid 173->183 but lowered by talking with the Thayan army), so thanks to them, he avoids instant death). He is suddenly back in the real world, he falls, Garren catches him, and Gnog's resistance bounces him back once more, on the very edge of death, holding onto a last shred of consciousness. He and his friends watch as the blue head is cleaved apart, the vast form of Tiamat crumbles and, shrieking, she falls away into ashes that draw down into the shrinking portal. Gone, in but an instant.

The temple shudders and cracks; masonry falls. As in all good stories of good against evil, the villain's lair crumbles. Ketmera pulls Deni onto her back. Sarqarim helps Fee Ree onto the Griffon, then flies to them. Garren drags Gnog away from the closing portal, joining the group as all narrowly dodge falling debris. Garren speaks of using his one, held back spell for him and Gnog to escape through a Dimension Door, presuming the others will use their great on-foot or flying speed in a dramatic, desperate last flee from danger. But this time, life treats them more kindly. Sarqarim still has one big spell - he casts Teleport. The group blink out of position. All that remains is an empty temple to evil, the portal to Avernus closing, with all collapsing to dust.

There is a shift; they are in the battlefield. No fighting nearby. There are wounded all around - it is a field hospital, protected by enchantment. The sun has recently set, leaving the sky a mixture of fading oranges and gradients of cool blue. 

The ground shakes, with deep booms and rumbles that everyone feels as much as hears. There are loud but distant sounds of crazed screeching and chittering. Staggering to their feet, the party sees Chromatic dragons either fleeing or enraged, trying to raze the ground around them. Amongst the chaos, the caldera is collapsing in on itself. Vast columns of bright fire and strange dark energies burst forth, rather than lava.

"Did we... Is she - ?" stutters Sarqarim as they stand, unsure, on the edge of their own exhausted collapse. Shouts are heard across the camp and the extended battlefield, where scattered remnant battles are still underway, as the sight of the failing caldera and crazed Chromatics gives a clear enough message that tells every soldier in every corner of battle - there can be no doubt.

Tiamat has fallen. *Victory*.

Skyreach descends with ropes dropped, giants climbing up to safety. It looks like, whatever their losses, they may have gained more in turned allies. With some still hanging on the ropes, it ascends rapidly and starts to pull away, fleeing for fear of damage from the volcano. Near us, we see some of the wounded are mercenaries from the other side, defeated and regretful; elves, dwarves, humans, beasts... It's confusing and noisy. More loud shouting, nearby this time, and strange shimmering disturbances burst across the sky as magical shields protect against stones and boulders blasting forth from the caldera, that rain down all around.

We sink to the ground, sitting on the grass. There is talk around us of immediate return to Elturel, to get clear of this place, to treat our wounded and deal with the mess later. Gnog apologises to Deni - the hoard is buried under the volcano now! She's pretty sure they'll dig it out, somehow. Too much wealth to leave behind and, besides, it is needed across the length and breadth of the land. The six are helped onto a cart, with the druids stepping forth to help the army pass through the nearby woods, emerging via trees at the grove that had been grown outside Elturel. Ketmera goes to help. Fee Ree and Deni collapse, unconscious; or at least, in a deep sleep. Gnog loses track of where Sarqarim or Garren have gone and starts to slip away too, but suddenly, he hears a familiar voice.

"Gnog?" - it's the voice from the strange vision. The voice of Bahamut. He forces his eyes open and standing over him is not a dragon, but Garren. A strange, shifting overlay of some other entity is briefly visible... It is Garren, but not Garren. Gnog tries to stand, but can only find strength to sit upright.

Garren speaks softly and calmly, his expression earnest; Garren's body, but Bahamut's voice at first. It shifts and changes, at times Garren, at times Bahamut, at times both.

"Thank you. You've been a good friend. You stayed true in difficult times. You led when you needed to, but you weren't afraid to follow; I guided as best I could. The work here is done. You know, now, that there are many planes. Somewhere else, my help is needed again."

Garren smiles warmly. "Farewell, Gnog." He leans down and kisses Gnog on the forehead. "I will always be near to you, my friend."

In his shock and surprise and fatigue, Gnog has no time to think of anything to say; and just like that, in such a brief moment, in a sudden fading out of existence from this plane... Gnog's friend is gone. Where he once stood is now just empty air, with the darkening sky beyond. There is a sudden, lurching realisation - a profound and deep feeling of loss. His eyes welling with tears of confusion, anger and sorrow that he cannot stop, Gnog loses consciousness in the cart and crumples down into the hay.



(Druids portal evacuees through the forest trees, to safety. Spell upon spell, rank upon rank, slowly clearing the battlefield.)



Gnog awakes. Everything aches. The location is familiar, but impossible. Somehow, Elturel; he sees the familiar light of the Companion mixed in with the sunlight. It feels like the early morning. Did he really sleep through days of travel? No, not days; hurts too much. The druids. Must've been the druids...

He sits up a little. A tent; Fee Ree and Deni are nearby... Oh. No Garren. Gnog stops. He thinks for a moment... No. *Not like this*. A little rougher than he should be, he shakes Fee Ree and Deni awake, first *telling* them - then asking them - to come with him. Right now! He can't find words to explain, but as they reluctantly rise and follow him, they talk of a strange dream, quickly realising that they both shared a similar experience. Gnog walks swiftly, almost running, towards the city walls. Fee Ree can only just keep up. He asks the guard for a temple to Bahamut, but there isn't one. Helm, then? Yes. Where he first found Ontharr in Elthurel. He starts to go, but Deni catches his arm and stops him.

"He's gone, isn't he? Like, *gone*, gone. For good."

Gnog tries to reply, but the tears well in his eyes again and he can't seem to make his voice work well enough to form words. Shaking his head, in part embarrassed to cry, he just motions for them to follow. It's still early and the streets are quiet. They go quickly to the Helm temple, directly to the altar, and in surprise see Thaneros stood there, as if waiting. Gnog manages to compose himself for a greeting and a brief conversation. Vaskan's name comes up - "the one with that dragon scale shield?!" - he didn't just survive, but saved many lives. A hero. So many of them emerged today. A whole army of them.

Anger is building within, almost boiling over to rage. It's too dangerous to try and contain it, so instead, Gnog shouts his frustration at the altar, wanting to be loud enough to be heard all the way from the astral plane. "No! Get back here, right now! You're *not* leaving like that... You didn't even say goodbye to the others, I mean - not properly, not in real life..." - he tails off, feeling a bit silly.

Thaneros looks over, apparently understanding. "Ah, I see... Walk with me."

"But..."

Gnog hears something - someone, familiar; or maybe it is a feeling. It's inside, not out; Garren is asking him to go along. The three of them walk with Thaneros, taking a path up to the gardens. They talk of heroism, loss and friendship. Thaneros asks of the exact details of the final moments in the temple and Gnog does his best to recite them, initially thinking the memories would be as clear as events of a moment ago, but fumbling with the details when he tried to recall them. Deni and Fee Ree didn't know about the vision and tell Gnog that he never left, never moved; just struck Tiamat, then fell back and Garren caught him.

They walk all the way to the highest edge of the gardens, with the sweeping view of the city, Companion, and all lands around. Thaneros makes a gesture with his arm. "All of this, you saved. You five", he says, looking to them.

Gnog feels a sudden twinge of guilt for not fetching Ketmera too. "Yes... But... More than just us. Everyone. The army. Perhaps I understand everyone's loss more now... Thousands, tens of thousands. But, I can't help but feel for *us*... For me. Maybe I'm selfish but it's not *fair*..."

Deni looks up - "yes, he's really gone. Isn't he?"

Something stirs in the air. A movement, a formation; a shape appearing. Thaneros steps aside without really thinking, to make room for the new arrival. Garren stands there resplendent in his gleaming, undamaged Helm armour; incorporeal, but present. He speaks of worlds, of futures, of being taken out of time; 300 years beyond anyone he ever knew or loved - until he and Gnog ran into each other, and new friendships were made. But, he repeats, now it's time to continue elsewhere. He'll always be there; they can always speak; this isn't the worship of a god. It's the embrace of friends.

Gnog almost understands. He certainly understands that it is inevitable. A lump in his throat. Shaking hands. Tries to think of something to say this time, but again, can't quite speak; eventually, the best he can do... "Safe journey, my friend. If you ever need us, call. We'll come. And if you're able - drop by and tell us how you're doing some time". Deni and Fee Ree just watch in a solemn silence. Perhaps they'd already said enough from the privacy of their dreams.

Garren fades away into small glowing beads of light, motes, carried on the breeze. Gnog feels briefly frozen in the place and moment; he can't really deal.

They will miss him, this dear friend of theirs - his presence. His sword and shield, of course, but so many other things will be absent, too. The quiet humour, terrible attempts to be stealthy in plate armour and the way he could eat more of Fee Ree's cooking than any man of his size ever should, often rivalling even Gnog for appetite. For all that, though, he *is* only gone in body. This was not death for he truly is still with them, for comfort, advice, the reassurance of a friend nearby; in many ways, closer now than he could ever have been before. The emotions are conflicting and the party is unsure if they should cry from joy or sorrow. Gnog would cry from both, but Goliath's aren't supposed to cry.

Thaneros turns to the group. "And as for me, well, I came from Eberron. I found friendship here, too. There was work to be done, so I stayed... Did you give my note to Morgan?" Gnog nods - "yes; they seemed... Surprised. And impressed."

"Good. That was one important thing I really had to do. Thank you."

He takes off a medallion from around his neck and hands it to Gnog. "Please give this to Ontharr for me... He'll understand."

And with that, Thaneros fades into lights too.

The three stand there for a while, Gnog in the middle, holding a hand each of Deni and Fee Ree. Then a sending stone illuminates, bearing the tree design. Eliastra's stone. They still don't know who survived or fell in battle and a moment of renewed fear grips them.‚Ä®‚Ä®"Well, good news or bad, we have to know..." says Gnog, and picks up the stone. Eliastra's voice sounds almost impatient - "Where are you?! We're all at the grove!" - and Gnog feels a wave of relief so strong, that for a moment he can barely breathe.

Fee Ree tugs on his hand. "We should go, then". She's smiling.

They walk back down the gardens. Deni is asking questions - what now? She can't relax; they've always been just on the edge of some crisis, always in danger. Healing of body and spirit will take time, but heal they will. Still, who do they fight now? What do they do? And with that, in a flash, Gnog finally *truly* understands what the stone giant seer had said to him outside Nesmay, all those months ago; "I cannot see your future. I know not what that means."

Their future is unwritten because it is theirs alone to write.

Walking quietly for a while, back down into the streets of Elturel, now bustling with people going about their morning routines, they make their way through to find Ontharr at the Black Antlers. He's cheerful. The party needs that feeling now, but Gnog has to give him the medallion, nonetheless. Ontharr becomes gruff, tensing up a little, hiding his grief.

"Hmm. Did your Paladin fuck off, too?"

"...yeah. Yes, they had to go... Look, we're going to the encampment. People are wondering where we've gone. It'd be nice to have you along...?" - Gnog trails off, unsure if his timing sucks, but Onthar brightens up immediately.

"Right! Let's go." He unlocks and opens a nearby drawer, pulling out several large bags of money. "A lot of people need to be paid!"

They head towards the city wall. Ontharr starts to whistle a tune which after a while, Gnog remembers hearing Thaneros humming once, back in the palace gardens at Waterdeep.

Gnog turns to Deni and quietly says, "Hey, Deni?"‚Ä®‚Ä®"What?"

"We vanquished Tiamat. And we saved the world."

After a moment, Deni squeezes his hand tightly. They pass through the outer gate - just four people, connected to so many others, whose collective deeds will echo through the coming centuries; these survivors; these victors; these heroes. Just walking quietly together, to go and meet their friends.

(NEXT PLAY SESSION)

Gnog wonders if the camp will be sad or happy - or both. They head for the grove, which is past mid-way point of grove. There are far fewer people. More tents, large pavilions. Steady stream heading into city from the camp; they seem to be on errands or very injured people. It isn't manic, but busy. A nervous air. Ontharr heads off to pay people. We see various pavilions which we can't see inside, but can see one which is a medical tent. Many injured. Some look to have slept, some do not. We surmise it is around 11am.

We get to grove. It's super busy - people are still coming through. We find Eli. Janvair is injured, but will be OK. Lots of injured & missing, evacuation was hurried, there is more to be done bringing people through. We work with Emerald Enclave Rangers to help get people out of the grove and through into the camp. At this we learn that we were actually asleep an entire day - we came on the night after battle, but drunk stylee, we found our way to our tent, slept an entire day-night cycle until today.

There won't be any celebration; while there is victory, at least 1/3 of our forces perished so there is obviously sadness. Besides, there are too many wounded etc. who couldn't take part, and there is no longer any central command - it's not an army now, the battle is done - so it wouldn't be possible to organise it.

Over the next couple of days we catch up with people, bit by bit. Of Cormir, Henning / Western Sun ran the spearhead and lost a lot of people. At least 1/3. Henning didn't make it. They were fighting dragons. Wizards lost a few. But they had flair, operated as a unit, did lots of stuff e.g. Fidelius' own invention to chain the arcane gates. Fidelius invites us to see the kingdom some time. A small inland sea on the East (Sea Of Fallen Stars - we saw it from Thay). He gives us the runes to a teleportation circle.

Alagarthas is keen to return to the High Forest but want to be sure everyone is through from the battlefield. They feel the loss acutely; every one brings their kingdom closer to the brink - a last dying ember of a once grand civilisation. Eventually they decide that it is unlikely enough for anyone else to come through the portals, and depart for home. They may or may not stay in the High Forest, or move onto - say - another plane. Elsewhere, anyway. We wish them a safe journey.

By the end of the 3rd day, we learn of a late arrival who has headed to the docks - Larusta probably, so we hurry over to the docks immediately. Wolf is there, with Larusta; but one boat is missing and they toko significant losses. They went wide, South of the river, crossed stealthily and hid the longboats; then intentionally made a lot of noise to be a distraction - and it was going well until they properly got the attention of the Frost Giants. Dragons got involved too. They did get up towards the SE flank, lost about 20% in the end. They intend to go beyond Luskan, far North. Coming down South in winter.

That evening, the druids are closing down the portals. People are moving on. Delenn has come through. We talk a while, of how squabbling might now happen in council over treasure, but how kings and rulers don't really mean much to everyday people, and certainly nothing to beasts. Change doesn't happen so much there. He shows us groups of disparate people who have left to depart, and how despite the grief, through empathy and sympathy they are drawn together. Friendships from people who live leagues apart, but fought together - perhaps, not friendship; stronger - kinship.

(The first day of summer is two days away). That night, our circle of druids leaves for the Sacred Woods.

We find Ketmera. We never knew, but ask where she's from - the forest North of the old kingdom by the serpent hills. She maintains a stone circle there, mostly alone. We'll catch up again some time; she gives us the portable hole with the Draakhorn in it.

We head to the ship. Ophithana has been waiting (arguing with the dock master to keep docked!) and we head away. It takes about 6 days to go from Elturel all the way to Waterdeep, arriving back on the seventh. Thaneros' letter to Morgan was coordinate locations of ships that'd come through from other planes including Eberron. There's a pattern. A cycle to openings to the astral plane... A way home.

**We spend the days, the three of us, processing it.** Writing things down, like memoirs, just enjoying each other's company. It is hard to relax - not feel guilty about enjoying life for a moment.

We do finally hear back from Blagothkus - Gnog was getting quite worried. Been busy rehoming giants. Sustained damage, but repairable. We hope to see him again one day. He did carry a lot of giants away from battle.

**On arrival into the harbour,** we raise three cheers. Let them know we're back. Fee Ree and Morgan cast illusions of flying dolphins, fireworks and more. It's super busy - waterways are back open & the trade routes are busy again. The southern gate refugee camp has gone; we don't know what the situation is there. Upon docking, all of Goliath Drinks is waiting (Vaskan is still marching with his regiment, taking the long way home).

**Upon returning to pub** Gnog is struck by a flurry of visions of the past. Still life; the empty tavern, motes of dust, bright early summer sun. I see briefly the first day we stepped inside, then moments flash through my mind of times we'd all spent here. Gnog runs up the stairs - visions of a flash of Fee Ree's cloak heading up to the turret, Garren laughing down the corridor. In our shared room, neatly folded on his bed is his cloak. Also his full armour, the dragon sword, javelin of lightning, the shield, boots of Elvenkind and Amulet Of The Devout are there, but the lightning armour, falcion and other weaponry are gone; bag of holding; troll heart amulet etc. The belt of strength too. There is a prayer book - the one used to annotate. The last prayer has an addition.

**Where you are, there am I**
**A voice in your mind**
**A beat in your heart**
**Never too far**‚Ä®**With you always**
**(See you soon)**

Downstairs, prep is underway for lunch. Gnog spends time with Deni, who is struggling to process things; she was very close to Garren and isn't good at understanding the weird sense of abandonment. She'll get there, but needs support. Lunch is just "the family". There'll be a bigger party in the evening when the Sehanine's Bow crew arrive. We briefly visit Varja and return Leirol's pin, which gives her better health and reduces her fatigue.

The party is good, with a drinking game!

We return Garren's armour, pendant, boots, cloak, book and sword to the turret room. I take the javelin at Deni's request. We bring the shield and amulet to Helm's Hall. We learn that Garren had actually sponsored an orphanage wing in the Hall; the kids liked his tails of daring deeds, and of course through donations. They take the shield & amulet, putting them into a display room / contemplation room (no door, but an entranceway) with other things; and will make an engraving on a plaque with the prayer (above) & attribution. We commit to sometimes visiting to tell his stories, and keep donations going. Spending time in the room, I realise I somehow know a new ritual (Commune) which lets us speak with him for a minute.

The next while is downtime. We've not seen the city in flower / summer before - trees fully in leaf and so-on. It's greener than we perhaps expected. Deni wants to visit the Fearless Fletcher, where she sells all but one of her dragon slaying arrows/bolts for a whopping 24000gp. She hopes to never encounter another dragon! Besides, we always seemed to hold back using them unless we had a good plan to wear down resistances prior to shooting, and that's only every happened that one time. Deni's, well, kinda rich now.

(During our downtime, we do hear further from Blagothkus; the castle suffered a little extra damage from further dragon attacks after the battle, but are now safe in the grey peaks, headed North. Dropping off people as they want - he'd already said the fire giants were being a bit fractious! They did suffer losses but gained more than they lost. As a wider nation, they have fared badly; around 300 giants fell. But they gathered ~150-200 of the others to his cause, the remainder fleeing to do their own thing.)

We catch up with Dala and Elya, catch up also with Lousia, and head via Ilmata where Deni gives a large donation. Makes Gnog love her that little bit more somehow. Elya near the end of the visit checks in with Gnog and warns him to try and either set roots deep, or otherwise find purpose beyond destiny or glory; seeking it has driven other adventurers to depression or madness, because they can't quite deal with no longer having this big, epic story and purpose.

Dala mentions a festival tomorrow, the lighting of the flame at the Temple Of Selune (AKA House Of The Moon) - it burns for as long a particular summer constellation is in the sky. The Bronze dragon guarding Waterdeep is called Khirsah. We pay him a visit to say hello and let him know the ceremony is on tomorrow. He's still going to be around a little while, with a few rogue Chromatic dragons still roving around the countryside. In particular, he's waiting for the two black dragons of the Mere Of Dead Men to have definitely headed home.

In the evening at the tavern, Fee Ree confesses that she might have to leave. Her heart lies elsewhere - needs to find her husband. She's angry at Garren for leaving, because how can she go herself and abandon Deni, who already had her mother leave, then Garren go... She's had the choice taken from her by Garren's departure. If she goes, Gnog will come - should she want that - but it's not Gnog's choice either. He knows he *must* stay with Deni if she doesn't want to go either.

Heading outside to the stables, Gnog quietly tries the ritual to commune with Garren and finds it very easy when near or at the tavern, since Garren is anchored so closely there. Tries to tell Garren that if there's a next time, he should perhaps leave with a little more warning! Realises tho - sharing thoughts - that Garren was himself confused and didn't quite know how to do it. While this departure was something Bahamut had done many times, the part of that collection of consciousnesses that was Garren was doing it for the first time. Garren notes that he should probably say sorry to Deni for leaving like that, given what happened her mother. It is a form of closure, really, for both Gnog and Garren, and helps Gnog understand that Garren is still himself, and was also struggling - just doing the best he could. Deni and Gnog later talk a bit of this, to help each other understand.
The next day passes quietly with us preparing for the festival. **The Lighting Of The Flame**. We're mostly now in plain clothes. Deni's kept on the red leather for now, but our weapons are mostly left at home - we still carry one or two, but stowed. We climb to the ridge with many others, families, children, lights and dancing, until we watch the procession from Market up to the temple. Cold moonlight-tone energies swirl around until eventually the top is "burning" brightly with a strange arcane fire that looks more like moonlight. As it gets later and families with children leave, the remainder, who've been drinking plenty (!) to that point, get more merry and we dance and party, feeling more relaxed than we have in a long time.

Finally returning to the tavern, we climb once more to the turret room. Garren's armour is there. We look at the distant light from the temple and wonder if the flam is warm or cool. We can "feel" Garren; an emotional connection; a presence. We miss him, but acceptance is closer now than it was before. Our own friendship bonds have never felt stronger. With more of a calm, settled centre, we head to bed. Going down the stairs, out of the corner of his eye, Gnog is sure he seems some motes of light drifting for a moment, but grins and kind of shrugs it off as wishful thinking. In the turret room, unseen by us, stands the incorporeal Garren as if alongside the three of us, smiling.

**The next day is the council meeting. June 7th. Gnog's Birthday.**

Even Deni is relaxed enough to leave the armour at home today.

We arrive a bit early, but Thunderspells, Sir Istaval, along with Remalia and Leosin already there. Ontharr arrives shortly after along with Ravengard (Baldur's Gate Marshall). Dagult Neverember arrives with Rian, then Malandrek and Delenn shortly after; Conrad Braunanvil (Dwarf) too. A little later, Vajra, McCath and Captain Gisella. Near Thunderspells, a person from a while back - we met them at Silverymoon. One of their knights, tactician Searlus. Dala and Elya sit near us. At the front is an unknown-to-us, slightly overweight older human with a white beard and floppy gold-trimmet hat, sitting near Braunanvil. Leirol arrives and starts proceedings at 10am sharp.

There is a toast given, using the first of the summer teas grown actually on palace ground, to the future and promise of brighter days to come. Leirol thanks *everyone* present for their sacrifices and commitment. Remalia is asked to give as much of a complete account as currently understood for everything that happened. It is a high level view of how battle proceeded, but they have little information on what happened in the temple as most harpers that attended there ended up on rescue duties.

We are tasked with filling in much of the temple events. Remalia produces the mask, surrounded by a cage force. It's handed for Dala so that the Metallics can get hold of the mask & remove it from this plane. We are introduced during the story to Mirt ("Mirt The Moneylender"), the person we didn't recognise, who is basically rich. When the question of Garren is brought up, he recognises how well people speak of him, and offers to underwrite the orphanage via the city.

The question of losses comes up.

Cormyr: Isteval says, lost 1/4 of their forces, heavily in the Shining Company (> 1/3).
Daggerford: Isteval also describes this: rebuilding continues with docks nearly restored, but they lost an awful 1/2 of their people (!).
Dwarves: lost 1/2 of the war machines, around 1/5 of the troops, others beaten up but healing and expected to recover.
Elves: 150 elves fell, including *everyone* in the temple, 1/5 of their overall forces also.
Neverember: His mercenaries: About 10%
We do have news about Amn, reported by Dagult / Rian: included in the above 10%.
Waterdeep: Gisella reports heavy losses, about 1/4 of the conscripts, which is pretty awful, 10% archers, 1/5 archers.
Silverymoon: Did well, about 10% loss. Lucky. Shadow Knights tended to appear in the right place at the right time, but foot soldiers got hit particularly hard even so; dragons breaking through defences would decimate them (huge boulders from giant attacks, too).
Gauntlet: Onthar reports fair losses but they weren't an army. Only about 20 people were permadead.
Harpers: Some losses but Remalia won't be drawn on losses. Numbers can expose identities of their agents etc. and reports that over 200 prisoners were rescued from the tunnels beneath Tiamat's temple.
Rian: does not speak
McCath: No losses (!)
Baldur's Gate: Flaming Fist lost 10%, volunteers 1/5
Druids: Delenn is philosophical, isn't drawn on numbers, there we losses but life is rebounding quickly with Tiamat pushed back. Turlang (that huge ancient tree ent) is alive and safely back in his grove. No circle was completely wiped out. None of the rare fey creatures were lost somehow.
We report on giants: See above notes (some lost, overall gain); Larusta, ~1/5; Thay lost roughly 1/3.

They have lunch. Deni gives away that it's Gnogs birthday (!) and there is a cake. A speech is called for as a toast. Dagult Neverember takes the helm:

**"Let's raise a glass to the future that we have secured. This glass, that represents the hopes and dreams of the Sword Coast, that we have rescued; these dreams, that will now be allowed to realise; these hopes and families and lives that will now flourish. But also in this glass, the lives forever changed by what has brought them together, because through difficulty and trials the bonds of friendship are forged; and also, in this glass, as we drain it, we remember all those who have come before and all those who fell. May we remember them. It is one of those beautiful things, like a glass of wine, where all you remember after, all that lingers, is the sweet taste; the sweet memory. In death, in sacrifice, cleansed of all they did in life with only the purity of glory and love that remains. To the futures and to the friends of the past."**

Gisella, who returned on Deepwater's Fury, marched the army to Baldur's Gate and started to bring people onto boats to ferry them home. Remaining carts & supplies didn't need to be brought, so were gifted to Elturel and Baldur's Gate. Army arrival expected in 2 days time (for the 1st weekend of summer this year).

We are told that the Council Of Waterdeep has met and wishes to announce the birth of a new festival on the Waterdavian calendar to mark the event. Remembrance Day. On the 9th day - of Summer, it will be a holiday. For the inaugural day, there will be a parade from the docks through the city to the Hall Of Heroes to honour those who have fought. There will be a Remembrance Ceremony at the Hall. The ceremony will occur annually. A way to remember the fallen, and hold the lessons of how Tiamat was defeated. (That's why Mirt is there - bankrolls it, Leirol signs a document which formalises the ruling).

There is then a lot of logistics about retrieving the treasure. People remember that the magic items must be released. There is some debate about that. We help with information on where the hoard was, how much seemed magical (was mostly in a separate chamber) and reassure them that there was *plenty* of wealth in the main hoard. People still need to be recovered from the battlefield. The Emerald Enclave wants to be there too - the land around the Well was largely destroyed, and needs to be repaired - a lot of druids and magic. 

On logistics also, cities will individually release their dragons as their situation became secure. Elturel for example will do so immediately, as will Baldur's Gate and the elves at the High Forest, since their army is back now. Waterdeep will hold on a little, until at least after the festival. As the refugee camps disband, it's easy enough to protect the surrounding lands themselves. Neverwinter needs to hold on a while. Silverymoon will release theirs once the army is back.

In closing the meeting, Leirol thanks specifically the Harpers for their early warnings, diligence and tenacity. She bestows upon us the honorary title of **Protectors Of The Sword Coast**. It has gravitas and meaning amongst member states of the Sword Coast, if nothing else. The room agrees that it extends diplomatic access to all member states. Doors shall always be open - from Elven Kingdoms, the Dwarven Holds and Cities of Lords Alliance - Daggerford, Baldur's Gate, Silverymoon, Neverwinter, Waterdeep.

Gnog thanks them, and implores them to try and work together. Most in the room seem to agree, but Malandrek has a hint of scepticism. He has seen this before and it might last a few decades, but eventually the squabbles remain. Braunanvil doesn't speak and finishes his drink - with him, it's a little different; it's more just that his job is done and the dwarves will just become kind of insular again and let everyone else get on with it. They'll be in their mountain holds - they're isolationists.

As things wind up, Deni asks Rian - what are they getting out of this? Must be something! Rian says that they've an "arrangement" with Neverember - they'll be recompenced by a share of what he secures (or already has). And she reiterates that the Zentarim are always open to trade, if Deni needs anything...

McCath wants to study the Draakhorn. It's agreed, but Vajra puts a Gaes (a compelling spell) on McCath to ensure that Dala & Elya get the horn once she's done - and she only has 28 days, because of the spell's duration. She agrees. She's writing a book. The information will go in there. It's not secret.

Catch up with Delenn: Turns out he knows Ketmera. Delenn offers the option one day of Gnog being aligned/affiliated with the Enclave. We thank him for restoring the land around the Well.

The Dwarves are reopening their embassy in Nesmay. They may well reopen diplomacy with Silverymoon.

We speak with Melandrek about future plans, and the extreme valour and bravery of his fallen elves.

Our final conversation is with Leirol. Mirt reiterates that he'll support the orphanage on behalf of the city, in perpetuity. They also offer a gift from the city, despite its limited resources; they commit a share of what they get back from the Well, so that we might at least be able to live off that and not have to go adventuring again. We are given paperwork that assigns 2% of the hoard - Gnog lets Deni take it. We take the remaining cake in a "doggy bag" for the tavern.

So that's it. We head out; it's all over.

======

When returning to the tavern, we see someone drop down from a nearby building and head up to us. It's Leosin. He invites Deni to be a Harper. Gives her a Harper pin, the one we had ages ago to gain access in the early days, then heads away.

We get back to the tavern. Outside, Deni talks about not really wanting to be employed by anyone. She'd like to sail the seas, Duskhollow in winter, Waterdeep in summer; they don't have to work. Maybe find a college and learn. Gnog thinks they are going their separate ways, but when Fee Ree brings up finding Arcxid, Deni is up for it. We resolve, when it feels right and when we have an idea how to proceed, to do it - together. Gnog's kind of quiet at that, looking a bit choked up and Deni half-jokingly tells him to cheer up.
"Cheer up...? I thought it was the right thing to do - that... To let you go; to let you both say goodbye and do what you had to do. But I don't have to. We're going to do it together - somehow... **I'm the happiest Goliath in the world**." 

**We go into the tavern and Deni shouts, "Guys! We have cake!". We hear the sound of Halfling feet running down the stairs.**

*This ends Campaign Two.*
