# Campaign Two

The continued adventures of goliath barbarian Arrin "Gnog" Ogolakanu, human paladin Garren Bronson, human rogue Deni Tumble and dragonborn sorceress Fee-Ree Jharthraxyn.



## Part 1
### Wrath Of Tiamat (Escalation)

The party portals to Waterdeep, buys a tavern (The Goliath Drinks), the Draakhorn sounds and the party is drawn deeper into the fight against the cult. From as far north as Luskan to as far south as Baldur's Gate, from owls flying above the frozen wastes to battles in catacombs below the Serpent Hills, there's only one big problem left: Can we take the horses back through the portal?



## Part 2
### Wrath Of Tiamat (Doubt)

Our path is set by being brought to the ancient dragon Convention Of The Five. We fight in the Misty Forest and are reunited with Blagothkus on Skyreach, before a terrifying trip to the eastern land of Thay looking for further allies. How far from the light will the party stray in its quest for aid, and what does it become in so doing?



## Part 3
### Wrath Of Tiamat (Arise)

We have a strange time at Xonthal's Tower hoping to find a blue mask and encountering - and this time, besting - an old foe back from our very first dragon encounter. New friends are made. The war council is convened; an assassination attempt fails, though Deni's horse is killed; the plan with Skyreach is set in motion.

War is imminent. We set sail for Baldur's Gate and the onward march to the Well Of Dragons.



## Part 4
### Wrath Of Tiamat (War)

All forces are gathered and calculated. The plan is drawn; the war commences.

In the end, we find that it is difficult to finish a campaign when so emotionally invested. There are arrivals and departures, considerations of future and past. The imaginary camera pulls away for one last view of the beauty of Faerûn...

...the two seers on Skyreach are looking in their cauldron and see something surprising...

...the camera returns to Duskhollow and the cottage. It is night time. The door is open, warm light spilling out, the murmur of conversation and laughter. Gnog and Cedric are facing us. Cedric waves. They turn, Cedric raising his branch hand to hold Gnog's and hand in hand, they walk inside. The door closes.
