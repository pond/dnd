> *(At the very end, we see the cottage at Duskhollow; we close in to a framing of the windows and front door. It's dusk, with warm light spilling out of the open door and around the edges of closed shutters. Cedric is there, facing us. He smiles and waves as Gnog walks in from the side. Cedric turns to face him, then they both turn towards the door. Cedric stretches up an arm to take Gnog's hand and they walk inside. As the music fades, we briefly hear muffled sounds of conversation and laughter which in turn fade out along with the music)*
