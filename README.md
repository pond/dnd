Various public resources related to D&D campaigns we've run.

## Playlists

When we first started playing a campaign, background music - which lots of people seem to like - worked well for us too. I even eventually wrote [Dungeon Panda](https://github.com/pond/dungeon_panda/) to help easily switch between "moods". Wanting to avoid "cheesy synth orchestra" music, I instead looked to TV, movie and modern game soundtracks. After a while, certain moments of near-perfect coincidental choice of a random track for a moment in play created an association between those 'set piece scenes' and the music.

From this, inevitably perhaps, playlists were born. The GM put a huge amount of time and effort into extending and adapting source material, creating deep, evolving characters, both PC and NPC alike, in a world of rich history and culture. It would be amazing to have a cartoon, CGI or even live-action movie made of the campaigns we played, but of course, that's not going to happen! Instead, we contented ourselves with imaginary movies of our campaigns, through attempts to choose music that fits our experiences.

Initially the playlists skip through "real time play" quite quickly as they were filled in after-the-fact, but later they get more detailed as they were developed alongside the game. For those that know any particular piece, it might be distracting at first since there'll be a preconceived notion of what the track represents, but hopefully as whole, the music has a certain emotional flow and logic.

Each playlist has its own prologue, chapters, epilogue and end titles made from two contemporary pieces of music. The first always represents a party character or (when there are more playlists then there are party members) some other significant character(s) or place(s). The second track always represents D&D and its worlds as a whole. We imagine appropriate in-credits animations and background scenes that fit those two tracks. There are no post-credits scenes except in the final "movie" of any full party campaign set (e.g. at campaign 2 or campaign 4 ending).

Maybe you'll enjoy them, maybe not; any game of D&D is uniquely personal to the people that play it. No two games are alike, especially if a GM is adapting the material dynamically as gameplay evolves. Even so, it meant a great deal to us.
